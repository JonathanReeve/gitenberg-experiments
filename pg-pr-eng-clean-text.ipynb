While he\\nwas at Carlsbad he heard the news. Then he received a letter from\\nEdith, speaking with deference and solicitude of Bruce's rheumatism,\\nentreating him to do the cure thoroughly, and suggesting that they\\nshould call the little girl Matilda, after a rich and sainted--though\\nstill living--aunt of Edith's. It might be an advantage to the child's\\nfuture (in every sense) to have a godmother so wealthy and so\\nreligious. It appeared from the detailed description that the new\\ndaughter had, as a matter of course (and at two days old), long golden\\nhair, far below her waist, sweeping lashes and pencilled brows, a\\nrosebud mouth, an intellectual forehead, chiselled features and a tall,\\nelegant figure. She was a magnificent, regal-looking creature and was a\\nsuperb beauty of the classic type, and yet with it she was dainty and\\nwinsome. She had great talent for music. This, it appeared, was shown\\nby the breadth between the eyes and the timbre of her voice.\\n\\nOverwhelmed with joy at the advent of such a paragon, and horrified at\\nEdith's choice of a name, Bruce had replied at once by wire,\\nimpulsively:\\n\\n_'Certainly not Matilda I would rather she were called Aspasia.'_\\n\\nEdith read this expression of feeling on a colourless telegraph form,\\nand as she was, at Knightsbridge, unable to hear the ironical tone of\\nthe message she took it literally.\\n\\nShe criticised the name, but was easily persuaded by her mother-in-law\\nto make no objection. The elder Mrs Ottley pointed out that it might\\nhave been very much worse.\\n\\n'But it's not a pretty name,' objected Edith. 'If it wasn't to be\\nMatilda, I should rather have called her something out of\\nMaeterlinck--Ygraine, or Ysolyn--something like that.'\\n\\n'Yes, dear, Mygraine's a nice name, too,' said Mrs Ottley, in her\\nhumouring way, 'and so is Vaselyn. But what does it really matter? I\\nshouldn't hold out on a point like this. One gets used to a name. Let\\nthe poor child be called Asparagus if he wishes it, and let him feel he\\nhas got his own way.'\\n\\nSo the young girl was named Aspasia Matilda Ottley. It was\\ncharacteristic of Edith that she kept to her own point, though not\\naggressively. When Bruce returned after his after-cure, it was too\\nlate to do anything but pretend he had meant it seriously.\\n\\nArchie called his sister Dilly.\\n\\nArchie had been rather hurt at the--as it seemed to him--unnecessary\\nexcitement about Dilly. Not that he was jealous in any way. It was\\nrather that he was afraid it would spoil her to be made so much of at\\nher age; make her, perhaps, egotistical and vain. But it was not\\nArchie's way to show these fears openly. He did not weep loudly or\\nthrow things about as many boys might have done. His methods were more\\nroundabout, more subtle. He gave hints and suggestions of his views\\nthat should have been understood by the intelligent. He said one\\nmorning with some indirectness:\\n\\n'I had such a lovely dream last night, Mother.'\\n\\n'Did you, pet? How sweet of you. What was it?'\\n\\n'Oh, nothing much. It was all right. Very nice. It was a lovely dream.\\nI dreamt I was in heaven.'\\n\\n'Really! How delightful. Who was there?'\\n\\nThis is always a woman's first question.\\n\\n'Oh, you were there, of course. And father. Nurse, too. It was a lovely\\ndream. Such a nice place.'\\n\\n'Was Dilly there?'\\n\\n'Dilly? Er--no--no--she wasn't. She was in the night nursery, with\\nSatan.'\\n\\nSometimes Edith thought that her daughter's names were decidedly a\\nfailure--Aspasia by mistake, Matilda through obstinacy, and Dilly by\\naccident. However the child herself was a success. She was four years\\nold when the incident occurred about the Mitchells. The whole of this\\nstory turns eventually on the Mitchells.\\n\\nThe Ottleys lived in a concise white flat at Knightsbridge. Bruce's\\nfather had some time ago left him a good income on certain conditions;\\none was that he was not to leave the Foreign Office before he was\\nfifty. One afternoon Edith was talking to the telephone in a voice of\\nagonised entreaty that would have melted the hardest of hearts, but did\\nnot seem to have much effect on the Exchange, which, evidently, was not\\nresponsive to pathos that day.\\n\\n'Oh! Exchange, _why_ are you ringing off? _Please_ try again.... Do I\\nwant any number? Yes, I do want any number, of course, or why should I\\nring up?... I want 6375 Gerrard.'\\n\\nHere Archie interposed.\\n\\n'Mother, can I have your long buttonhook?'\\n\\n'No, Archie, you can't just now, dear.... Go away Archie.... Yes, I\\nsaid 6375 Gerrard. Only 6375 Gerrard!... Are you there? Oh, don't keep\\non asking me if I've got them!... No, they haven't answered.... Are you\\n6375?... Oh--wrong number--sorry.... 6375 Gerrard? Only six--are you\\nthere?... Not 6375 Gerrard?... Are you anyone else?... Oh, is it you,\\nVincy?... I want to tell you--'\\n\\n'Mother, can I have your long buttonhook?'\\n\\nHere Bruce came in. Edith rang off. Archie disappeared.\\n\\n'It's really rather wonderful, Edith, what that Sandow exerciser has\\ndone for me! You laughed at me at first, but I've improved\\nmarvellously.'\\n\\nBruce was walking about doing very mild gymnastics, and occasionally\\nhitting himself on the left arm with the right fist.' Look at my\\nmuscle--look at it--and all in such a short time!'\\n\\n'Wonderful!' said Edith.\\n\\n'The reason I know what an extraordinary effect these few days have had\\non me is something I have just done which I couldn't have done before.\\nOf course I'm naturally a very powerful man, and only need a little--'\\n\\n'What have you done?'\\n\\n'Why--you know that great ridiculous old wooden chest that your awful\\nAunt Matilda sent you for your birthday--absurd present I call it--mere\\nlumber.'\\n\\n'Yes?'\\n\\n'When it came I could barely push it from one side of the room to the\\nother. Now I've lifted it from your room to the box-room. Quite\\neasily. Pretty good, isn't it?'\\n\\n'Yes, of course it's very good for you to do all these exercises; no\\ndoubt it's capital.... Er--you know I've had all the things taken out\\nof the chest since you tried it before, don't you?'\\n\\n'Things--what things? I didn't know there was anything in it.'\\n\\n'Only a silver tea-service, and a couple of salvers,' said Edith, in a\\nlow voice....\\n\\n...He calmed down fairly soon and said: 'Edith, I have some news for\\nyou. You know the Mitchells?'\\n\\n'Do I know the _Mitchells_? Mitchell, your hero in your office, that\\nyou're always being offended with--at _least_ I know the Mitchells by\\n_name_. I ought to.'\\n\\n'Well, what do you think they've done? They've asked us to dinner.'\\n\\n'Have they? Fancy!'\\n\\n'Yes, and what I thought was so particularly jolly of him was that it\\nwas a verbal invitation. Mitchell said to me, just like this, 'Ottley,\\nold chap, are you doing anything on Sunday evening?''\\n\\nHere Archie came to the door and said, 'Mother, can I have your long\\nbuttonhook?'\\n\\nEdith shook her head and frowned.\\n\\n''Ottley, old chap,'' continued Bruce, ''are you and your wife doing\\nanything on Sunday? If not, I do wish you would waive ceremony and come\\nand dine with us. Would Mrs Ottley excuse a verbal invitation, do you\\nthink?' I said, 'Well, Mitchell, as a matter of fact I don't believe we\\nhave got anything on. Yes, old boy, we shall be delighted.' I accepted,\\nyou see. I accepted straight out. When you're treated in a friendly\\nway, I always say why be unfriendly? And Mrs Mitchell is a charming\\nlittle woman--I'm sure you'd like her. It seems she's been dying to\\nknow you.'\\n\\n'Fancy! I wonder she's still alive, then, because you and Mitchell have\\nknown each other for eight years, and I've never met her yet.'\\n\\n'Well, you will now. Let bygones be bygones. They live in Hamilton\\nPlace.'\\n\\n'Oh yes....Park Lane?'\\n\\n'I told you he was doing very well, and his wife has private means.'\\n\\n'Mother,' Archie began again, like a litany, 'can I have your long\\nbuttonhook? I know where it is.'\\n\\n'No, Archie, certainly not; you can't fasten laced boots with a\\nbuttonhook.... Well, that will be fun, Bruce.'\\n\\n'I believe they're going to have games after dinner,' said Bruce. 'All\\nvery jolly--musical crambo--that sort of thing.... What shall you wear,\\nEdith?'\\n\\n'Mother, do let me have your long buttonhook. I want it. It isn't for\\nmy boots.'\\n\\n'_Certainly_ not. What a nuisance you are! Do go away.... I think I\\nshall wear my salmon-coloured dress with the sort of mayonnaise-\\ncoloured sash.... (No, you're not to have it, Archie).'\\n\\n'But, Mother, I've got it.... I can soon mend it, Mother.'\\n\\nOn Sunday evening Bruce's high spirits seemed to flag; he had one of\\nhis sudden reactions. He looked at everything on its dark side.\\n\\n'What on earth's that thing in your hair, Edith?'\\n\\n'It's a bandeau.'\\n\\n'I don't like it. Your hair looks very nice without it. What on _earth_\\ndid you get it for?'\\n\\n'For about six-and-eleven, I think.'\\n\\n'Don't be trivial, Edith. We shall be late. Ah! It really does seem\\nrather a pity, the very first time one dines with people like the\\nMitchells.'\\n\\n'We sha'n't be late, Bruce. It's eight o'clock, and eight o'clock I\\nsuppose means--well, eight. Sure you've got the number right?'\\n\\n'Really. Edith!... My memory is unerring, dear. I never make a mistake.\\nHaven't you ever noticed it?'\\n\\n'A--oh yes--I think I have.'\\n\\n'Well, it's 168 Hamilton Place. Look sharp, dear.'\\n\\nOn their way in the taxi he gave her a good many instructions and\\nadvised her to be perfectly at her ease and _absolutely natural_; there\\nwas nothing to make one otherwise, in either Mr or Mrs Mitchell. Also,\\nhe said, it didn't matter a bit what she wore, as long as she had put\\non her _best_ dress. It seemed a pity she had not got a new one, but\\nthis couldn't be helped, as there was now no time. Edith agreed that\\nshe knew of no really suitable place where she could buy a new evening\\ndress at eight-thirty on Sunday evening. And, anyhow, he said, she\\nlooked quite nice, really very smart; besides, Mrs Mitchell was not the\\nsort of person who would think any the less of a pretty woman for being\\na little dowdy and out of fashion.\\n\\nWhen they drove up to what house agents call in their emotional way a\\nsuperb, desirable, magnificent town mansion, they saw that a large\\ndinner-party was evidently going on. A hall porter and four powdered\\nfootmen were in evidence.\\n\\n'By Jove!' said Bruce, as he got out, 'I'd no idea old Mitchell did\\nhimself so well as this.'... The butler had never heard of the\\nMitchells. The house belonged to Lord Rosenberg.\\n\\n'Confound it! 'said Bruce, as he flung himself into the taxi. 'Well!\\nI've made a mistake for once in my life. I admit it. Of course, it's\\nreally Hamilton Gardens. Sorry. Yet somehow I'm rather glad Mitchell\\ndoesn't live in that house.'\\n\\n'You are perfectly right,' said Edith: 'the bankruptcy of an old friend\\nand colleague could be no satisfaction to any man.'\\n\\nHamilton Gardens was a gloomy little place, like a tenement building\\nout of Marylebone Road. Bruce, in trying to ring the bell,\\nunfortunately turned out all the electric light in the house, and was\\nstanding alone in despair in the dark when, fortunately the porter, who\\nhad been out to post a letter, ran back, and turned up the light\\nagain.... 'I shouldn't have thought they could play musical crambo\\nhere, 'he called out to Edith while he was waiting. 'And now isn't it\\nodd? I have a funny kind of feeling that the right address is Hamilton\\nHouse.'\\n\\n'I suppose you're perfectly certain they don't live at a private idiot\\nasylum?' Edith suggested doubtfully.\\n\\nOn inquiry it appeared the Mitchells did not live at Hamilton Gardens.\\nAn idea occurred to Edith, and she asked for a directory.\\n\\nThe Winthrop Mitchells lived at Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood.\\n\\n'At last!' said Bruce. 'Now we shall be too disgracefully late for the\\nfirst time. But be perfectly at your ease, dear. Promise me that. Go in\\nquite naturally.'\\n\\n'How else can I go in?'\\n\\n'I mean as if nothing had happened.'\\n\\n'I think we'd better tell them what _has_ happened,' said Edith; 'it\\nwill make them laugh. I hope they will have begun their dinner.'\\n\\n'Surely they will have finished it.'\\n\\n'Perhaps we may find them at their games!'\\n\\n'Now, now, don't be bitter, Edith dear--never be bitter--life has its\\nups and downs.... Well! I'm rather glad, after all, that Mitchell\\ndoesn't live in that horrid little hole.'\\n\\n'I'm sure you are,' said Edith; 'it could be no possible satisfaction\\nto you to know that a friend and colleague of yours is either\\ndistressingly hard up or painfully penurious.'\\n\\nThey arrived at the house, but there were no lights, and no sign of\\nlife. The Mitchells lived here all right, but they were out. The\\nparlourmaid explained. The dinner-party had been Saturday, the night\\nbefore....\\n\\n'Strange,' said Bruce, as he got in again. 'I had a curious\\npresentiment that something was going wrong about this dinner at the\\nMitchells'.'\\n\\n'What dinner at the Mitchells'? There doesn't seem to be any.'\\n\\n'Do you know,' Bruce continued his train of thought, 'I felt certain\\nsomehow that it would be a failure. Wasn't it odd? I often think I'm a\\npessimist, and yet look how well I'm taking it. I'm more like a\\nfatalist--sometimes I hardly know what I am.'\\n\\n'I could tell you what you are,' said Edith, 'but I won't, because now\\nyou must take me to the Carlton. We shall get there before it's\\nclosed.'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nOpera Glasses\\n\\nWhether to behave with some coolness to Mitchell, and be stand-offish,\\nas though it had been all his fault, or to be lavishly apologetic, was\\nthe question. Bruce could not make up his mind which attitude to take.\\nIn a way, it was all the Mitchells' fault. They oughtn't to have given\\nhim a verbal invitation. It was rude, Bohemian, wanting in good form;\\nit showed an absolute and complete ignorance of the most ordinary and\\nelementary usages of society. It was wanting in common courtesy;\\nreally, when one came to think about it, it was an insult. On the other\\nhand, technically, Bruce was in the wrong. Having accepted he ought to\\nhave turned up on the right night. It may have served them right (as he\\nsaid), but the fact of going on the wrong night being a lesson to them\\nseemed a little obscure. Edith found it difficult to see the point.\\n\\nThen he had a more brilliant idea; to go into the office as cheerily as\\never, and say to Mitchell pleasantly, 'We're looking forward to next\\nSaturday, old chap,' pretending to have believed from the first that\\nthe invitation had been for the Saturday week; and that the dinner was\\nstill to come....\\n\\nThis, Edith said, would have been excellent, provided that the\\nparlourmaid hadn't told them that she and Bruce had arrived about a\\nquarter to ten on Sunday evening and asked if the Mitchells had begun\\ndinner. The chances against the servant having kept this curious\\nincident to herself were almost too great.\\n\\nAfter long argument and great indecision the matter was settled by a\\ncordial letter from Mrs Mitchell, asking them to dinner on the\\nfollowing Thursday, and saying she feared there had been some mistake.\\nSo that was all right.\\n\\nBruce was in good spirits again; he was pleased too, because he was\\ngoing to the theatre that evening with Edith and Vincy, to see a play\\nthat he thought wouldn't be very good. He had almost beforehand settled\\nwhat he thought of it, and practically what he intended to say.\\n\\nBut when he came in that evening he was overheard to have a strenuous\\nand increasingly violent argument with Archie in the hall.\\n\\nEdith opened the door and wanted to know what the row was about.\\n\\n'Will you tell me, Edith, where your son learns such language? He keeps\\non worrying me to take him to the Zoological Gardens to see\\nthe--well--you'll hear what he says. The child's a perfect nuisance.\\nWho put it into his head to want to go and see this animal? I was\\nobliged to speak quite firmly to him about it.'\\n\\nEdith was not alarmed that Bruce had been severe. She thought it much\\nmore likely that Archie had spoken very firmly to him. He was always\\nstrict with his father, and when he was good Bruce found fault with\\nhim. As soon as he grew really tiresome his father became abjectly\\napologetic.\\n\\nArchie was called and came in, dragging his feet, and pouting, in tears\\nthat he was making a strenuous effort to encourage.\\n\\n'You must be firm with him,' continued Bruce. 'Hang it! Good heavens!\\nAm I master in my own house or am I not?'\\n\\nThere was no reply to this rhetorical question.\\n\\nHe turned to Archie and said in a gentle, conciliating voice:\\n\\n'Archie, old chap, tell your mother what it is you want to see. Don't\\ncry, dear.'\\n\\n'Want to see the damned chameleon,' said Archie, with his hands in his\\neyes. 'Want father to take me to the Zoo.'\\n\\n'You can't go to the Zoo this time of the evening. What do you mean?'\\n\\n'I want to see the damned chameleon.'\\n\\n'You hear!' exclaimed Bruce to Edith.\\n\\n'Who taught you this language?'\\n\\n'Miss Townsend taught it me.'\\n\\n'There! It's dreadful, Edith; he's becoming a reckless liar. Fancy her\\ndreaming of teaching him such things! If she did, of course she must be\\nmad, and you must send her away at once. But I'm quite sure she\\ndidn't.'\\n\\n'Come, Archie, you know Miss Townsend never taught you to say that.\\nWhat have you got into your head?'\\n\\n'Well, she didn't exactly teach me to say it--she didn't give me\\nlessons in it--but she says it herself. She said the damned chameleon\\nwas lovely; and I want to see it. She didn't say I ought to see it. But\\nI want to. I've been wanting to ever since. She said it at lunch today,\\nand I do want to. Lots of other boys go to the Zoo, and why shouldn't\\nI? I want to see it so much.'\\n\\n'Edith, I must speak to Miss Townsend about this very seriously. In the\\nfirst place, people have got no right to talk about queer animals to\\nthe boy at all--we all know what he is--and in such language! I should\\nhave thought a girl like Miss Townsend, who has passed examinations in\\nGermany, and so forth, would have had more sense of her\\nresponsibility--more tact. It shows a dreadful want of--I hardly know\\nwhat to think of it--the daughter of a clergyman, too!'\\n\\n'It's all right, Bruce,' Edith laughed. 'Miss Townsend told me she had\\nbeen to see the _Dame aux Camelias_ some time ago. She was enthusiastic\\nabout it. Archie dear, I'll take you to the Zoological Gardens and\\nwe'll see lots of other animals. And don't use that expression.'\\n\\n'What! Can't I see the da--'\\n\\n'Mr Vincy,' announced the servant.\\n\\n'I must go and dress,' said Bruce.\\n\\nVincy Wenham Vincy was always called by everyone simply Vincy. Applied\\nto him it seemed like a pet name. He had arrived at the right moment,\\nas he always did. He was very devoted to both Edith and Bruce, and he\\nwas a confidant of both. He sometimes said to Edith that he felt he was\\njust what was wanted in the little home; an intimate stranger coming in\\noccasionally with a fresh atmosphere was often of great value (as, for\\ninstance, now) in calming or averting storms.\\n\\nHad anyone asked Vincy exactly what he was he would probably have said\\nhe was an Observer, and really he did very little else, though after he\\nleft Oxford he had taken to writing a little, and painting less. He was\\nvery fair, the fairest person one could imagine over five years old. He\\nhad pale silky hair, a minute fair moustache, very good features, a\\nsingle eyeglass, and the appearance, always, of having been very\\nrecently taken out of a bandbox.\\n\\nBut when people fancied from this look of his that he was an\\nempty-headed fop they soon found themselves immensely mistaken.\\n\\nHe was thirty-eight, but looked a gilded youth of twenty; and _was_\\nsufficiently gilded (as he said), not perhaps exactly to be\\ncomfortable, but to enable him to get about comfortably, and see those\\nwho were.\\n\\nHe had a number of relatives in high places, who bored him, and were\\nalways trying to get him married. He had taken up various occupations\\nand travelled a good deal. But his greatest pleasure was the study of\\npeople. There was nothing cold in his observation, nothing of the\\ncynical analyst. He was impulsive, though very quiet, immensely and\\nardently sympathetic and almost too impressionable and enthusiastic. It\\nwas not surprising that he was immensely popular generally, as well as\\nspecially; he was so interested in everyone except himself.\\n\\nNo-one was ever a greater general favourite. There seemed to be no type\\nof person on whom he jarred. People who disagreed on every other\\nsubject agreed in liking Vincy.\\n\\nBut he did not care in the least for acquaintances, and spent much\\ningenuity in trying to avoid them; he only liked intimate friends, and\\nof all he had perhaps the Ottleys were his greatest favourites.\\n\\nHis affection for them dated from a summer they had spent in the same\\nhotel in France. He had become extraordinarily interested in them. He\\ndelighted in Bruce, but had with Edith, of course, more mutual\\nunderstanding and intellectual sympathy, and though they met\\nconstantly, his friendship with her had never been misunderstood.\\nFrivolous friends of his who did not know her might amuse themselves by\\nbeing humorous and flippant about Vincy's little Ottleys, but no-one\\nwho had ever seen them together could possibly make a mistake. They\\nwere an example of the absurdity of a tradition--'the world's'\\nproneness to calumny. Such friendships, when genuine, are never\\nmisconstrued. Perhaps society is more often taken in the other way. But\\nas a matter of fact the truth on this subject, as on most others, is\\nalways known in time. No-one had ever even tried to explain away the\\nintimacy, though Bruce had all the air of being unable to do without\\nVincy's society sometimes cynically attributed to husbands in a\\ndifferent position.\\n\\nVincy was pleased with the story of the Mitchells that Edith told him,\\nand she was glad to hear that he knew the Mitchells and had been to the\\nhouse.\\n\\n'How like you to know everyone. What did they do?'\\n\\n'The night I was there they played games,' said Vincy. He spoke in a\\nsoft, even voice. 'It was just a little--well--perhaps just a _tiny_\\nbit ghastly, I thought; but don't tell Bruce. That evening I thought\\nthe people weren't quite young enough, and when they played 'Oranges\\nand Lemons, and the Bells of St Clements,' and so on--their bones\\nseemed to--well, sort of rattle, if you know what I mean. But still\\nperhaps it was only my fancy. Mitchell has such very high spirits, you\\nsee, and is determined to make everything go. He won't have\\nconventional parties, and insists on plenty of verve; so, of course,\\none's forced to have it.' He sighed. 'They haven't any children, and\\nthey make a kind of hobby of entertaining in an unconventional way.'\\n\\n'It sounds rather fun. Perhaps you will be asked next Thursday. Try.'\\n\\n'I'll try. I'll call, and remind her of me. I daresay she'll ask me.\\nShe's very good-natured. She believes in spiritualism, too.'\\n\\n'I wonder who'll be there?'\\n\\n'Anyone might be there, or anyone else. As they say of marriage, it's a\\nlottery. They might have roulette, or a spiritual seance, or Kubelik,\\nor fancy dress heads.'\\n\\n'Fancy dress heads!'\\n\\n'Yes. Or a cotillion, or just bridge. You never know. The house is\\nrather like a country house, and they behave accordingly. Even\\nhide-and-seek, I believe, sometimes. And Mitchell adores unpractical\\njokes, too.'\\n\\n'I see. It's rather exciting that I'm going to the Mitchells at last.'\\n\\n'Yes, perhaps it will be the turning-point of your life,' said Vincy.\\n'Ah! here's Bruce.'\\n\\n'I don't think much of that opera glass your mother gave you,' Bruce\\nremarked to his wife, soon after the curtain rose.\\n\\n'It's the fashion,' said Edith. 'It's jade--the latest thing.'\\n\\n'I don't care if it is the fashion. It's no use. Here, try it, Vincy.'\\n\\nHe handed it to Vincy, who gave Bruce a quick look, and then tried it.\\n\\n'Rather quaint and pretty, I think. I like the effect,' he said,\\nhanding it back to Bruce.\\n\\n'It may be quaint and pretty, and it may be the latest thing, and it\\nmay be jade,' said Bruce rather sarcastically, 'but I'm not a slave to\\nfashion. I never was. And I don't see any use whatever in an opera\\nglass that makes everything look smaller instead of larger, and at a\\ngreater distance instead of nearer. I call it rot. I always say what I\\nthink. And you can tell your mother what I said if you like.'\\n\\n'You're looking through it the wrong side, dear,' said Edith.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nThe Golden Quoribus\\n\\nEdith had been very pretty at twenty, but at twenty-eight her\\nprettiness had immensely increased; she had really become a beauty of a\\nparticularly troubling type. She had long, deep blue eyes, clearly-cut\\nfeatures, hair of that soft, fine light brown just tinged with red\\ncalled by the French chatain clair; and a flower-like complexion. She\\nwas slim, but not angular, and had a reposeful grace and a decided\\nattraction for both men and women. They generally tried to express this\\nfascination by discovering resemblances in her to various well-known\\npictures of celebrated artists. She had been compared to almost every\\ntype of all the great painters: Botticelli, Sir Peter Lely,\\nGainsborough, Burne-Jones. Some people said she was like a Sargent,\\nothers called her a post-impressionist type; there was no end to the\\nold and new masters of whom she seemed to remind people; and she\\ncertainly had the rather insidious charm of somehow recalling the past\\nwhile suggesting something undiscovered in the future. There was a good\\ndeal that was enigmatic about her. It was natural, not assumed as a\\npose of mysteriousness. She was not all on the surface: not obvious.\\nOne wondered. Was she capable of any depth of feeling? Was she always\\njust sweet and tactful and clever, or could there be another side to\\nher character? Had she (for instance) a temperament? This question was\\nconsidered one of interest,--so Edith had a great many admirers. Some\\nwere new and fickle, others were old and faithful. She had never yet\\nshown more than a conversational interest in any of them, but always\\nseemed to be laughing with a soft mockery at her own success.\\n\\nEdith was not a vain woman, not even much interested in dress, though\\nshe had a quick eye and a sure impressionistic gift for it. She was\\nalways an immense favourite with women, who felt subconsciously\\ngrateful to her for her wonderful forbearance. To have the power and\\nnot to use it! To be so pretty, yet never _to take_ _anyone away_!--not\\neven coldly display her conquests. But this liking she did not, as a\\nrule, return in any decided fashion. She had dreadfully little to say\\nto the average woman, except to a few intimate friends, and frankly\\npreferred the society of the average man, although she had not as yet\\ndeveloped a taste for coquetry, for which she had, however, many\\nnatural gifts. She was much taken up by Bruce, by Archie and Dilly, and\\nwas fond of losing herself in ideas and in books, and in various\\nartistic movements and fads in which her interest was cultivated and\\nperhaps inspired by Vincy. Vincy was her greatest friend and confidant.\\nHe was really a great safety-valve, and she told him nearly every\\nthought.\\n\\nStill, Archie was, so far, her greatest interest. He was a particularly\\npretty boy, and she was justified in thinking him rather unusual. At\\nthis period he spent a considerable amount of his leisure time not only\\nin longing to see real animals, but in inventing and drawing pictures\\nof non-existent ones--horrible creatures, or quaint creatures, for\\nwhich he found the strangest names. He told Dilly about them, but Dilly\\nwas not his audience--she was rather his confidante and literary\\nadviser; or even sometimes his collaborator. His public consisted\\nprincipally of his mother. It was a convention that Edith should be\\nfrightened, shocked and horrified at the creatures of his imagination,\\nwhile Dilly privately revelled in their success. Miss Townsend, the\\ngoverness, was rather coldly ignored in this matter. She had a way of\\nspeaking of the animals with a smile, as a nice occupation to keep the\\nchildren quiet. She did not understand.\\n\\n'Please, Madam, would you kindly go into the nursery; Master Archie\\nwishes you to come and hear about the golden--something he's just made\\nup like,' said Dilly's nurse with an expression of resignation.\\n\\nEdith jumped up at once.\\n\\n'Oh dear! Tell Master Archie I'm coming.'\\n\\nShe ran into the nursery and found Archie and Dilly both looking rather\\nexcited; Archie, fairly self-controlled, with a paper in his hand on\\nwhich was a rough sketch which he would not let her see, and hid behind\\nhim.\\n\\n'Mother,' Archie began in a low, solemn voice, rather slowly, 'the\\ngolden quoribus is the most horrible animal, the most awful-looking\\nanimal, you ever heard of in _your_ life!'\\n\\n'Oh-h-h! How awful!' said Edith, beginning to shiver. 'Wait a\\nmoment--let me sit down quietly and hear about it.'\\n\\nShe sat down by the fire and clasped her hands, looking at him with a\\nterrified expression which was part of the ritual.\\n\\nDilly giggled, and put her thumb in her mouth, watching the effect with\\nwidely opened eyes.\\n\\n'Much more awful than the gazeka, of course, I suppose?' Edith said\\nrather rashly.\\n\\n'Much,' said Dilly.\\n\\n'(Be quiet, Dilly!) Mother!' he was reproachful, 'what do you mean? The\\ngazeka? Why--the gazeka's nothing at all--it's a rotten little animal.\\nIt doesn't count. Besides, it isn't real--it never was real. Gazeka,\\nindeed!'\\n\\n'Oh, I beg your pardon,' said Edith repentantly; 'do go on.'\\n\\n'No... the golden quoribus is far-ar-r-r-r more frightening even than\\nthe jilbery. Do you remember how awful _that_ was? And much larger.'\\n\\n'What! Worse than the jilbery! Oh, good gracious! How dreadful! What's\\nit like?'\\n\\n'First of all--it's as long as from here to Brighton,' said Archie.\\n\\n'A little longer,' said Dilly.\\n\\n'(Shut up, miss!) As long. It's called the golden quoribus because it's\\nbright gold, except the bumps; and the bumps are green.'\\n\\n'Bright green,' said Dilly.\\n\\n'(Oh, will you hold your tongue, Dilly?) Green.'\\n\\n'How terrible!... And what shape is it?'\\n\\n'All pointed and sharp, and three-cornered.'\\n\\n'Does it breathe fire?' asked Edith.\\n\\nArchie smiled contemptuously.\\n\\n'Breathe fire! Oh, Mother! Do you think it's a silly dragon in a fairy\\nstory? Of course it doesn't. How can it breathe fire?'\\n\\n'Sorry,' said Edith apologetically. 'Go on.'\\n\\n'_But_, the peculiar thing about it, besides that it lives entirely on\\nmuffins and mutton and the frightening part, I'm coming to now.' He\\nbecame emphatic, and spoke slowly. 'The golden quoribus has more claws\\nthan any... other... animal... in the whole world!'\\n\\n'Oh-h-h,' she shuddered.\\n\\n'Yes,' said Archie solemnly. 'It has large claws coming out of its\\nhead.'\\n\\n'Its head! Good gracious!'\\n\\n'It has claws here and claws there; claws coming out of the eyes; and\\nclaws coming out of the ears; and claws coming out of its shoulders;\\nand claws coming out of the forehead!'\\n\\nEdith shivered with fright and held up her hands in front of her eyes\\nto ward off the picture.\\n\\n'And claws coming out of the mouth,' said Archie, coming a step nearer\\nto her and raising his voice.\\n\\nEdith jumped.\\n\\n'And claws coming out of the hands, and claws coming out of the feet!'\\n\\n'Yes,' said Dilly, wildly and recklessly and jumping up and down, 'and\\nclaws on the ceiling, and claws on the floor, and claws all over the\\nworld!'\\n\\nWith one violent slap she was sent sprawling.\\n\\nShrieks, sobs and tears filled the quiet nursery.\\n\\n'I know,' said Archie, when he had been persuaded to apologise, 'of\\ncourse I know a gentleman oughtn't to hit a lady, not even--I mean,\\nespecially not if she's his little sister. But oh, Mother, ought a lady\\nto interrupt a story?'\\n\\nWhen Edith told Vincy he entirely took Archie's side.\\n\\nSuppose Sargent were painting a beautiful picture, and one of his\\npupils, snatching the paint-brush from him, insisted on finishing it,\\nand spoiling it--how would he like it? Imagine a poet who had just\\nwritten a great poem, and been interrupted in reciting it by someone\\nwho quickly finished it off all wrong! The author might be forgiven\\nunder such circumstances if in his irritation he took a strong line. In\\nVincy's opinion it served Dilly jolly well right. Young? Of course she\\nwas young, but four (he said) was not a day too soon to begin to learn\\nto respect the work of the artist. Edith owned that Archie was not\\neasily exasperated and was as a rule very patient with the child. Bruce\\ntook an entirely different view. He was quite gloomy about it and\\nfeared that Archie showed every sign of growing up to be an Apache.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nThe Mitchells\\n\\nThe Mitchells were, as Vincy had said, extremely hospitable; they had a\\nperfect mania for receiving; they practically lived for it, and the big\\nhouse at Hampstead, with its large garden covered in, and a sort of\\nstudio built out, was scarcely ever without guests. When they didn't\\nhave some sort of party they invariably went out.\\n\\nMitchell's great joy was to make his parties different from others by\\nsome childish fantasy or other. He especially delighted in a surprise.\\nHe often took the trouble (for instance) to have a telegram sent to\\nevery one of his guests during the course of the evening. Each of these\\nwires contained some personal chaff or practical joke. At other times\\nhe would give everyone little presents, concealed in some way.\\nChristmas didn't come once a year to the Mitchells; it seemed never to\\ngo away. One was always surprised not to find a Christmas tree and\\ncrackers. These entertainments, always splendidly done materially, and\\ncuriously erratic socially, were sometimes extremely amusing; at\\nothers, of course, a frost; it was rather a toss-up.\\n\\nAnd the guests were, without exception, the most extraordinary mixture\\nin London. They included delightful people, absurd people, average\\npeople; people who were smart and people who were dowdy, some who were\\nrespectable and nothing else, some who were deplorable, others\\nbeautiful, and many merely dull. There was never the slightest attempt\\nat any sort of harmonising, or of suitability; there was a great deal\\nof kindness to the hard-up, and a wild and extravagant delight in any\\nnovelty. In fact, the Mitchells were everything except exclusive, and\\nas they were not guided by any sort of rule, they really lived, in St\\nJohn's Wood, superior to suburban or indeed any other restrictions.\\nThey would ask the same guests to dinner time after time, six or seven\\ntimes in succession. They would invite cordially a person of no\\nattraction whatsoever whom they had only just met, and they would\\nbehave with casual coolness to desirable acquaintances or favourite\\nfriends whom they had known all their lives. However, there was no\\ndoubt that their parties had got the name for being funny, and that was\\nquite enough. London people in every set are so desperate for something\\nout of the ordinary way, for variety and oddness, that the Mitchells\\nwere frequently asked for invitations by most distinguished persons who\\nhoped, in their blase fatigue, to meet something new and queer.\\n\\nFor the real Londoner is a good deal of a child, and loves Punch and\\nJudy shows, and conjuring tricks (symbolically speaking)--and is also\\noften dreaming of the chance of meeting some spring novelty, in the way\\nof romance. Although the Mitchells were proud of these successes they\\nwere as free from snobbishness as almost anyone could be. On the whole\\nMrs Mitchell had a slight weakness for celebrities, while Mr Mitchell\\npreferred pretty women, or people who romped. It was merely from\\ncarelessness that the Ottleys had never been asked before.\\n\\nWhen Edith and Bruce found themselves in the large square\\ncountry-house-looking hall, with its oak beams and early English\\nfireplace, about twenty people had arrived, and as many more were\\nexpected. A lively chatter had already begun; for each woman had been\\noffered on her arrival a basket from which she had to choose a brightly\\ncoloured ribbon. These ribbons matched the rosettes presented in an\\nequally haphazard way to every man. As Vincy observed, it gave one the\\nrather ghastly impression that there was going to be a cotillion at\\nonce, on sight, before dinner; which was a little frightening. In\\nreality it was merely so that the partners for the meal should be\\nchosen by chance. Mitchell thought this more fun than arranging guests;\\nbut there was an element of gambling about it that made wary people\\nnervous. Everyone present would have cheated had it been possible. But\\nit was not.\\n\\nMrs Mitchell was a tiny brown-eyed creature, who looked absurdly young;\\nshe was kind, sprightly, and rather like a grouse. Mitchell was a\\njovial-looking man, with a high forehead, almost too much ease of\\nmanner, and a twinkling eye.\\n\\nThe chief guests tonight consisted of Lord Rye, a middle-aged\\nsuffraget, who was known for his habit of barking before he spoke and\\nfor his wonderful ear for music--he could play all Richard, Oscar and\\nJohann Strauss's compositions by ear on the piano, and never mixed them\\nup; Aylmer Ross, the handsome barrister; Myra Mooney, who had been on\\nthe stage; and an intelligent foreigner from the embassy, with a\\ndecoration, a goat-like beard, and an Armenian accent. Mrs Mitchell\\nsaid he was the minister from some place with a name like Ruritania.\\nShe had a vague memory. There was also a Mr Cricker, a very young man\\nof whom it was said that he could dance like Nijinsky, but never would;\\nand the rest were chiefly Foreign Office clerks (like Mitchell and\\nBruce), more barristers and their wives, a soldier or two, some\\nundergraduates, a lady photographer, a few pretty girls, and vague\\npeople. There were to be forty guests for dinner and a few more in the\\nevening.\\n\\nAlmost immediately on her arrival Edith noticed a tall, clean-shaven\\nman, with smooth fair hair, observant blue eyes, and a rather humorous\\nexpression, and she instantly decided that she would try to will him to\\ntake her to dinner. (Rather a superfluous effort of magnetism, since it\\nmust have been settled already by fate and the ribbons.) It was obvious\\nfrom one quick glance that he shared the wish. To their absurdly great\\nmutual disappointment (a lot of ground was covered very quickly at the\\nMitchells), their ribbons didn't match, and she was taken to dinner by\\nCaptain Willis, who looked dull. Fortune, however, favoured her. On her\\nother side she found the man who looked amusing. He was introduced to\\nher across the table by Mrs Mitchell, with _empressement_, as Mr Aylmer\\nRoss.\\n\\nEdith felt happy tonight; her spirits were raised by what she felt to\\nbe an atmosphere _tiede_, as the French say; full of indulgence,\\nsympathetic, relaxing, in which either cleverness or stupidity could\\nfloat equally at its ease. The puerility of the silly little\\narrangements to amuse removed all sense of ceremony. The note is always\\nstruck by the hostess, and she was everything that was amiable, without\\neffort or affectation.\\n\\nNo-one was ever afraid of her.\\n\\nBruce's neighbour at dinner was the delicate, battered-looking\\nactress, in a Royal fringe and a tight bodice with short sleeves, who\\nhad once been a celebrity, though no-one remembered for what. Miss Myra\\nMooney, formerly a beauty, had known her days of success. She had been\\nthe supreme performer of ladylike parts. She had been known as the very\\nquintessence of refinement. It was assumed when she first came out that\\na duke would go to the devil for her in her youth, and that in her late\\nmaturity she would tour the provinces with _The Three Musketeers_.\\nNeither of these prophecies had, however, been fulfilled. She still\\noccasionally took small middle-aged titled parts in repertoire\\nmatinees. She was unable to help referring constantly to the hit she\\nmade in _Peril_ at Manchester in 1887; nor could she ever resist\\nspeaking of the young man who sent her red carnations every day of his\\nblighted existence for fifteen years; a pure romance, indeed, for, as\\nshe owned, he never even wished to be introduced to her. She still\\ncalled him poor boy, oblivious of the fact that he was now sixty-eight,\\nand, according to the illustrated papers, spent his entire time in\\ngiving away a numberless succession of daughters in brilliant marriage\\nat St George's, Hanover Square.\\n\\nIn this way Miss Mooney lived a good deal in the past, but she was not\\nunaware of the present, and was always particularly nice to people\\ngenerally regarded as bores. So she was never without plenty of\\ninvitations. Mitchell had had formerly a slight _tendre_ for her, and\\nin his good nature pretended to think she had not altered a bit. She\\nwas still refined _comme cela ne se fait plus_; it was practically no\\nlonger possible to find such a perfect lady, even on the stage. As she\\nalso had all the easy good nature of the artist, and made herself\\nextremely agreeable, Bruce was delighted with her, and evidently\\nthought he had drawn a prize.\\n\\n'I wondered,' Aylmer Ross said, 'whether this could possibly happen.\\nFirst I half hoped it might; then I gave it up in despair.'\\n\\n'So did I,' said Edith; 'and yet I generally know. I've a touch of\\nsecond sight, I think--at dinner-parties.'\\n\\n'Oh, well, I have second sight too--any amount; only it's always wrong.\\nHowever!...'\\n\\n'Aren't the Mitchells dears?' said Edith.\\n\\n'Oh, quite. Do you know them well?'\\n\\n'Very well, indeed. But I've never seen them before.'\\n\\n'Ah, I see. Well, now we've found our way here--broken the ice and that\\nsort of thing--we must often come and dine with them, mustn't we, Mrs\\nOttley? Can't we come again next week?'\\n\\n'Very sweet of you to ask us, I'm sure.'\\n\\n'Not at all; very jolly of us to turn up. The boot is on the other leg,\\nor whatever the phrase is. By the way, I'm sure you know everything,\\nMrs Ottley, tell me, did people ever wear only one boot at a time, do\\nyou think, or how did this expression originate?'\\n\\n'I wonder.'\\n\\nSomething in his suave manner of taking everything for granted seemed\\nto make them know each other almost too quickly, and gave her an odd\\nsort of self-consciousness. She turned to Captain Willis on her other\\nside.\\n\\n'I say,' he said querulously, 'isn't this a bit off? We've got the same\\ncoloured ribbons and you haven't said a word to me yet! Rather rot,\\nisn't it, what?'\\n\\n'Oh, haven't I? I will now.'\\n\\nCaptain Willis lowered his voice to a confidential tone and said: 'Do\\nyou know, what I always say is--live and let live and let it go at\\nthat; what?'\\n\\n'That's a dark saying,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Have a burnt almond,' said Captain Willis inconsequently, as though it\\nwould help her to understand. 'Yes, Mrs Ottley, that's what I always\\nsay.... But people won't, you know--they won't--and there it is.' He\\nseemed resigned. 'Good chap, Mitchell, isn't he? Musical chairs, I\\nbelieve--that's what we're to play this evening; or bridge, whichever\\nwe like. I shall go in for bridge. I'm not musical.'\\n\\n'And which shall you do?' asked Aylmer of Edith. He had evidently been\\nlistening.\\n\\n'Neither.'\\n\\n'We'll talk then, shall we? I can't play bridge either.... Mrs\\nOttley--which is your husband? I didn't notice when you came in.'\\n\\n'Over there, opposite; the left-hand corner.'\\n\\n'Good-looking chap with the light moustache--next to Myra Mooney?'\\n\\n'That's it,' she said. 'He seems to be enjoying himself. I'm glad he's\\ngot Miss Mooney. He's lucky.'\\n\\n'He is indeed,' said Aylmer.\\n\\n'She's a wonderful-looking woman--like an old photograph, or someone in\\na book,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Do you care for books?'\\n\\n'Oh, yes, rather. I've just been discovering Bourget. Fancy, I didn't\\nknow about him! I've just read _Mensonges_ for the first time.'\\n\\n'Oh yes. Rather a pompous chap, isn't he? But you could do worse than\\nread _Mensonges_ for the first time.'\\n\\n'I _have_ done worse. I've been reading Rudyard Kipling for the last\\ntime.'\\n\\n'Really! Don't you like him? Why?'\\n\\n'I feel all the time, somehow, as if he were calling me by my Christian\\nname without an introduction, or as if he wanted me to exchange hats\\nwith him,' she said. 'He's so fearfully familiar with his readers.'\\n\\n'But you think he keeps at a respectful distance from his characters?\\nHowever--why worry about books at all, Mrs Ottley? Flowers, lilies of\\nthe field, and so forth, don't toil or spin; why should they belong to\\nlibraries? I don't think you ever ought to read--except perhaps\\nsometimes a little poetry, or romance.... You see, that is what you\\nare, rather, isn't it?'\\n\\n'Don't you care for books?' she answered, ignoring the compliment. 'I\\nshould have thought you loved them, and knew everything about them. I'm\\nnot sure that I know.'\\n\\n'You know quite enough, believe me,' he answered earnestly. 'Oh, don't\\nbe cultured--don't talk about Lloyd George! Don't take an intelligent\\ninterest in the subjects of the day!'\\n\\n'All right; I'll try not.'\\n\\nShe turned with a laugh to Captain Willis, who seemed very depressed.\\n\\n'I say, you know,' he said complainingly, 'this is all very well. It's\\nall very well no doubt. But I only ask one thing--just one. Is this\\ncricket? I merely ask, you know. Just that--is it cricket; what?'\\n\\n'It isn't meant to be. What's the matter?'\\n\\n'Why, I'm simply fed up and broken-hearted, you know. Hardly two words\\nhave I had with you tonight, Mrs Ottley.... I suppose that chap's\\nawfully amusing, what? I'm not amusing.... I know that.'\\n\\n'Oh, don't say that. Indeed you are.' she consoled him.\\n\\n'Am I though?'\\n\\n'Well, you amuse _me_!'\\n\\n'Right!' He laughed cheerily. He always filled up pauses with a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nThe Surprise\\n\\nCertainly Mrs Mitchell on one side and Captain Willis on the other had\\nsuffered neglect. But they seemed to become hardened to it towards the\\nend of dinner....\\n\\n'I have a boy, too,' Aylmer remarked irrelevantly, 'rather a nice chap.\\nJust ten.'\\n\\nThough only by the merest, slightest movement of an eyelash Edith could\\nnot avoid showing her surprise. No-one ever had less the air of a\\nmarried man. Also, she was quite ridiculously disappointed. One can't\\nsay why, but one doesn't talk to a married man quite in the same way or\\nso frankly as to a bachelor--if one is a married woman. She did not ask\\nabout his wife, but said:\\n\\n'Fancy! Boys are rather nice things to have about, aren't they?'\\n\\nShe was looking round the table, trying to divine which was Mrs Aylmer\\nRoss. No, she wasn't there. Edith felt sure of it. It was an\\nunaccountable satisfaction.\\n\\n'Yes; he's all right. And now give me a detailed description of _your_\\nchildren.'\\n\\n'I can't. I never could talk about them.'\\n\\n'I see.... I should like to see them.... I saw you speak to Vincy. Dear\\nlittle fellow, isn't he?'\\n\\n'He's a great friend of mine.'\\n\\n'I'm tremendously devoted to him, too. He's what used to be called an\\nexquisite. And he _is_ exquisite; he has an exquisite mind. But, of\\ncourse, you know what a good sort he is.'\\n\\n'Rather.'\\n\\n'He seems rather to look at life than to act in it, doesn't he?'\\ncontinued Aylmer. 'He's a brilliant sort of spectator. Vincy thinks\\nthat all the world's a stage, but _he's_ always in the front row of the\\nstalls. I never could be like that ... I always want to be right in the\\nthick of it, on in every scene, and always performing!'\\n\\n'To an audience?' said Edith.\\n\\nHe smiled and went on.\\n\\n'What's so jolly about him is that though he's so quiet, yet he's\\ngenial; not chilly and reserved. He's frank, I mean--and confiding.\\nWithout ever saying much. He expresses himself in his own way.'\\n\\n'That's quite true.'\\n\\n'And, after all, it's really only expression that makes things real.\\n'If you don't talk about a thing, it has never happened.''\\n\\n'But it doesn't always follow that a thing has happened because you do\\ntalk about it,' said Edith. 'Ah, Mrs Mitchell's going !'\\n\\nShe floated away.\\n\\nHe remained in a rather ecstatic state of absence of mind.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nMrs Mitchell gladly told Edith all about Aylmer Ross, how clever he\\nwas, how nice, how devoted to his little boy. He had married very\\nyoung, it seemed, and had lost his wife two years after. This was ten\\nyears ago, and according to Mrs Mitchell he had never looked at another\\nwoman since. Women love to simplify in this sentimental way.\\n\\n'However,' she said consolingly, 'he's still quite young, under forty,\\nand he's sure to fall in love and marry again.'\\n\\n'No doubt,' said Edith, wishing the first wife had remained alive. She\\ndisliked the non-existent second one.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNearly all the men had now joined the ladies in the studio, with the\\nexception of Bruce and of Aylmer Ross. Mrs Mitchell had taken an\\nimmense fancy to Edith and showed it by telling her all about a\\nwonderful little tailor who made coats and skirts better than Lucile\\nfor next to nothing, and by introducing to her Lord Rye and the embassy\\nman, and Mr Cricker. Edith was sitting in a becoming corner under a\\nshaded light from which she could watch the door, when Vincy came up to\\ntalk to her.\\n\\n'You seemed to get on rather well at dinner,' he said.\\n\\n'Yes; isn't Captain Willis a dear?'\\n\\n'Oh, simply sweet. So bright and clever. I was sure you'd like him,\\nEdith.'\\n\\nCaptain Willis here came up and said, a shade more jovially than he had\\nspoken at dinner, with his laugh:\\n\\n'Well, you know, Mrs Ottley, what I always say is--live and let live\\nand let it go at that; what? But they never _do_, you know! They\\nwon't--and there it is!'\\n\\nEdith now did a thing she had never done in her life before and which\\nwas entirely unlike her. She tried her utmost to retain the group round\\nher, and to hold their attention. For a reason of which she was hardly\\nconscious, she wanted Aylmer Ross to see her surrounded. The minister\\nfrom the place with a name like Ruritania was so immensely bowled over\\nthat he was already murmuring in a low voice (almost a hiss, as they\\nsay in melodrama): 'Vous etes chez vous, quand? Dites un mot, un mot\\nseulement, et je me precipiterai a vos pieds_,' while at the same time,\\nin her other ear, Lord Rye was explaining (to her pretended intense\\ninterest) how he could play the whole of _Elektra, The Chocolate\\nSoldier_ and _Nightbirds_ by ear without a single mistake. ('Perfectly\\nsound!' grumbled Captain Willis, 'but why do it?') Vincy was listening,\\nenjoying himself. Bruce came in at last, evidently engaged in an\\nabsorbed and intimate conversation with Aylmer Ross. They seemed so\\nmuch interested in their talk that they went to the other end of the\\nroom and sat down there together. Aylmer gave her one glance only.\\n\\nEdith was unreasonably annoyed. What on earth could he and Bruce find\\nto talk about? At length, growing tired of her position, she got up,\\nand walked across the room to look at a picture on the wall, turning\\nher graceful back to the room.\\n\\nBruce had now at last left his companion, but still Aylmer Ross did not\\ngo and speak to her, though he was sitting alone.\\n\\nMusical chairs began in the studio. Someone was playing 'Baby,\\nlook-a-here,' stopping suddenly in the middle to shouts of laughter and\\nshrieks from the romping players. In the drawing-room some of the\\npeople were playing bridge. How dull the rest of the evening was! Just\\nbefore the party practically broke up, Edith had an opportunity of\\nsaying as she passed Aylmer:\\n\\n'I thought we were going to have a talk instead of playing games?'\\n\\n'I saw you were occupied,' he answered ceremoniously. 'I didn't\\nlike--to interrupt.'\\n\\nShe laughed. 'Is this a jealous scene, Mr Ross?'\\n\\n'I wonder,' he said, smiling, 'and if so, whose. Well, I hope to see\\nyou again soon.'\\n\\n'_What_ a success your charming wife has had tonight,' said Mrs\\nMitchell to Bruce, as they took leave. 'Everyone is quite wild about\\nher. How pretty she is! You _must_ be proud of her.'\\n\\nThey were nearly the last. Mr Cricker, who had firmly refused the whole\\nevening, in spite of abject entreaties, to dance like Nijinsky,\\nsuddenly relented when everyone had forgotten all about it, and was\\nleaping alone in the studio, while Lord Rye, always a great lingerer,\\nwas playing Richard Strauss to himself on the baby Grand, and smoking a\\nhuge cigar.\\n\\n'Edith,' said Bruce solemnly, as they drove away, 'I've made a friend\\ntonight. There was one really charming man there--he took an immense\\nfancy to me.'\\n\\n'Oh--who was that?'\\n\\n'Who was that?' he mimicked her, but quite good-naturedly. 'How stupid\\nwomen are in some things! Why, Aylmer Ross, the chap who sat next to\\nyou at dinner! I suppose you didn't appreciate him. Very clever, very\\ninteresting. He was anxious to know several things which I was glad to\\nbe in a position to tell him. Yes--an awfully good sort. I asked him to\\ndine at my club one day, to go on with our conversation.'\\n\\n'Oh, did you?'\\n\\n'Yes. Why shouldn't I? However, it seems from what he said that he\\nthinks the Carlton's nicer for a talk, so I'm going to ask him there\\ninstead. You can come too, dear. He won't mind; it won't prevent our\\ntalking.'\\n\\n'Oh, are we going to give a dinner at the Carlton?'\\n\\n'I wish you wouldn't oppose me, Edith. Once in a way! Of course I\\nshall. Our flat's too small to give a decent dinner. He's one of the\\nnicest chaps I've ever met.'\\n\\n'Well, do you want me to write tomorrow morning then, dear?'\\n\\n'Er--no--I have asked him already.'\\n\\n'Oh, really--which day?'\\n\\n'Well, I suggested next Thursday--but he thought tomorrow would be\\nbetter; he's engaged for every other day. Now don't go and say you're\\nengaged tomorrow. If you are, you'll have to chuck it!'\\n\\n'Oh no; I'm not engaged.'\\n\\nMentally rearranging her evening dress, Edith drove home thoughtfully.\\nShe was attracted and did not know why, and for the first time hoped\\nshe had made an impression. It had been a long evening, and her\\nheadache, she said, necessitated solitude and darkness at once.\\n\\n'All right. I've got a much worse headache--gout, I think, but never\\nmind about me. Don't be anxious, dear! I say, that Miss Mooney is a\\nvery charming woman. She took rather a fancy to me, Edith. Er--you\\nmight ask her to dinner too, if you like, to make a fourth!'\\n\\n'But--really! Ought we to snatch all the Mitchells' friends the first\\ntime, Bruce?'\\n\\n'Why, of course, it's only courteous. It's all right. One must return\\ntheir hospitality.'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe Visit\\n\\nThe following afternoon Edith was standing by the piano in her\\ncondensed white drawing-room, trying over a song, which she was\\naccompanying with one hand, when to her surprise the maid announced 'Mr\\nAylmer Ross.' It was a warm day, and though there was a fire the\\nwindows were open, letting in the scent of the mauve and pink hyacinths\\nin the little window-boxes. She thought as she came forward to meet him\\nthat he seemed entirely different from last night. Her first impression\\nwas that he was too big for the room, her second that he was very\\nhandsome, and also a little agitated.\\n\\n'I really hardly know how to apologise, Mrs Ottley. I oughtn't to have\\nturned up in this cool way. But your husband has kindly asked me to\\ndine with you tonight, and I wasn't sure of the time. I thought I'd\\ncome and ask you.' He waited a minute. 'Of course, if I hadn't been so\\nfortunate as to find you in, I should just have left a note.' He looked\\nround the room.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nObviously it was quite unnecessary for him to have called; he could\\nhave sent the note that he had brought with him. She was flattered. She\\nthought that she liked his voice and the flash of his white teeth when\\nhe smiled.\\n\\n'Oh, I'm glad I'm at home,' she said, in a gentle way that put him at\\nhis ease, and yet at an immense distance. 'I felt in the mood to stop\\nat home and play the piano today. I'm delighted to see you.' They sat\\ndown by the fire. 'It's at eight tonight. Shall we have tea?'\\n\\n'Oh no, thanks; isn't it too early? I sha'n't keep you a moment. Thanks\\nvery much.... You were playing something when I came in. I wish you'd\\nplay it to me over again.'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNine women out of ten would have refused, saying they knew nothing of\\nmusic, or that they were out of practice, or that they never played\\nexcept for their own amusement, or something of the kind; especially if\\nthey took no pride whatever in that accomplishment. But Edith went back\\nto the piano at once, and went on trying over the song that she didn't\\nknow, without making any excuse for the faltering notes.\\n\\n'That's charming,' he said. 'Thanks. Tosti, of course.'\\n\\nShe came back to the fireplace. 'Of course. We had great fun last\\nnight, didn't we?'\\n\\n'Oh, _I_ enjoyed myself immensely; part of the time at least.'\\n\\n'But after dinner you were rather horrid, Mr Ross. You wouldn't come\\nand talk to me, would you?'\\n\\n'Wouldn't I? I was afraid. Tell me, do I seem many years older since\\nlast night?' he asked.\\n\\n'I don't see any difference. Why?'\\n\\n'Because I've lived months--almost years--since I saw you last. Time\\ndoesn't go by hours, does it?... What a charming little room this is.\\nIt suits you. There's hardly anything in it, but everything is right.'\\n\\n'I don't like to have many things in a room,' said Edith, holding out\\nher delicate hands to the fire. 'It makes me nervous. I have gradually\\naccustomed Bruce to my idea by removing one thing at a time\\n--photographs, pictures, horrid old wedding presents, all the\\nlittle things people have. They suggest too many different trains of\\nthought. They worry me. He's getting used to it now. He says, soon\\nthere'll be nothing left but a couple of chairs and a bookcase!'\\n\\n'And how right! I've had rather the same idea in my house, but I\\ncouldn't keep it up. It's different for a man alone; things seem to\\naccumulate; especially pictures. I know such a lot of artists. I'm very\\nunfortunate in that respect.... I really feel I oughtn't to have turned\\nup like this, Mrs Ottley.'\\n\\n'Why not?'\\n\\n'You're very kind.... Excuse my country manners, but how nice your\\nhusband is. He was very kind to me.'\\n\\n'He liked _you_ very much, too.'\\n\\n'He seems charming,' he repeated, then said with a change of tone and\\nwith his occasional impulsive brusqueness, 'I wonder--does he ever jar\\non you in any way?'\\n\\n'Oh no. Never. He couldn't. He amuses me,' Edith replied softly.\\n\\n'Oh, does he?... If I had the opportunity I wonder if I should _amuse_\\nyou,' he spoke thoughtfully.\\n\\n'No; I don't think you would at all,' said Edith, looking him straight\\nin the face.\\n\\n'That's quite fair,' he laughed, and seemed rather pleased. 'You mean I\\nshould bore you to death! Do forgive me, Mrs Ottley. Let's go on with\\nour talk of last night.... I feel it's rather like the Palace of Truth\\nhere; I don't know why. There must be something in the atmosphere--I\\nseem to find it difficult not to think aloud--Vincy, now--do you see\\nmuch of Vincy?'\\n\\n'Oh yes; he comes here most days, or we talk on the telephone.'\\n\\n'I see; he's your confidant, and you're his. Dear Vincy. By the way, he\\nasked me last night to go to a tea-party at his flat next week. He was\\ngoing to ask one or two other kindred spirits--as I think they're\\ncalled. To see something--some collection. Including you, of course?'\\n\\n'I shall certainly go,' said Edith, 'whether he asks me or not.'\\n\\nAylmer seemed to be trying to leave. He nearly got up once or twice and\\nsat down again.\\n\\n'Well, I shall see you tonight,' he said. 'At eight.'\\n\\n'Yes.'\\n\\n'What shall you wear, Mrs Ottley?'\\n\\n'Oh, I thought, perhaps, my mauve chiffon? What do you advise?' she\\nsmiled.\\n\\n'Not what you wore last night?'\\n\\n'Oh no.'\\n\\n'It was very jolly. I liked it. Er--red, wasn't it?'\\n\\n'Oh no! It was pink!' she answered.\\n\\nThen there was an extraordinary pause, in which neither of them seemed\\nable to think of anything to say. There was a curious sort of vibration\\nin the air.\\n\\n'Isn't it getting quite springy?' said Edith, as she glanced at the\\nwindow. 'It's one of those sort of warm days that seem to have got\\nmixed up by mistake with the winter.'\\n\\n'Very,' was his reply, which was not very relevant.\\n\\nAnother pause was beginning.\\n\\n'Mr Vincy,' announced the servant.\\n\\nHe was received with enthusiasm, and Aylmer Ross now recovered his ease\\nand soon went away.\\n\\n'Edith!' said Vincy, in a reproving tone. '_Really_! How _very_ soon!'\\n\\n'He came to know what time we dine. He was just passing.'\\n\\n'Oh, yes. He would want to know. He lives in Jermyn Street. I\\nsuppose Knightsbridge is on his way to there.'\\n\\n'From where?' she asked.\\n\\n'From here,' said Vincy.\\n\\n'What happened after we left?' said Edith. 'I saw the Cricker man\\nbeginning to dance with hardly anyone looking at him.'\\n\\n'Isn't his imitation of Nijinsky wonderful?' asked Vincy.\\n\\n'Simply marvellous! I thought he was imitating George Grossmith. Do you\\nknow, I love the Mitchells, Vincy. It's really great fun there. Fancy,\\nBruce seems so delighted with Aylmer Ross and Miss Mooney that he\\ninsisted on their both dining with us tonight.'\\n\\n'He seemed rather carried away, I thought. There's a fascination about\\nAylmer. There are so many things he's not,' said Vincy.\\n\\n'Tell me some of them.'\\n\\n'Well, for one thing, he's not fatuous, though he's so good-looking.\\nHe's not a lady-killing sort of person or anything else tedious.'\\n\\nShe was delighted at this especially.\\n\\n'If he took a fancy to a person--well, it might be rather serious, if\\nyou take my meaning,' said Vincy.\\n\\n'How sweet of him! So unusual. Do you like Myra Mooney?'\\n\\n'Me? Oh, rather; I'm devoted to her. She's a delightful type. Get her\\non to the subject of the red carnations. She's splendid about them....\\nShe received them every day at breakfast-time for fifteen years.\\nAnother jolly thing about Aylmer is that he has none of that awful\\nold-fashioned modernness, thank goodness!'\\n\\n'Ah, I noticed that.'\\n\\n'I suppose he wasn't brilliant today. He was too thrilled. But, do be\\njust a teeny bit careful, Edith dear, because when he is at all he's\\nvery much so. Do you see?'\\n\\n'What a lot you seem to think of one little visit, Vincy! After all, it\\nwas only one.'\\n\\n'There hasn't been time yet for many more, has there, Edith dear? He\\ncould hardly call twice the same day, on the first day, too.... Yes, I\\ncome over quite queer and you might have knocked me down with a\\nfeather, in a manner of speaking, when I clapped eyes on him setting\\nhere.'\\n\\nEdith liked Vincy to talk in his favourite Cockney strain. It\\ncontrasted pleasantly with his soft, even voice and _raffine_\\nappearance.\\n\\n'Here's Bruce,' she said.\\n\\nBruce came in carrying an enormous basket of gilded straw. It was\\nfilled with white heather, violets, lilies, jonquils, gardenias and\\nmimosa. The handle was trimmed with mauve ribbon.\\n\\n'Oh, Bruce! How angelic of you!'\\n\\n'Don't be in such a hurry, dear. These are not from me. They arrived\\njust at the same time that I did. Brought by a commissionaire. There\\nwas hardly room for it in the lift.'\\n\\nEdith looked quickly at the card. It bore the name of the minister of\\nthe place with a name like Ruritania.\\n\\n'What cheek!' exclaimed Bruce, who was really flattered. 'What infernal\\nimpertinence. Upon my word I've more than half a mind to go and tell\\nhim what I think of him--straight from the shoulder. What's the\\naddress?'\\n\\n'Grosvenor Square.'\\n\\n'Well, I don't care. I shall go straight to the embassy,' said Bruce.\\n'No, I sha'n't. I'll send them back and write him a line--tell him that\\nEnglishwomen are not in the habit of accepting presents from\\nundesirable aliens.... I consider it a great liberty. Aren't I right,\\nVincy?'\\n\\n'Quite. But perhaps he means no harm, Bruce. I daresay it's the custom\\nin the place with the funny name. You see, you never know, in a place\\nlike that.'\\n\\n'Then you don't think I ought to take it up?'\\n\\n'I don't want them. It's a very oppressive basket,' Edith said.\\n\\n'How like you, Edith! I thought you were fond of flowers.'\\n\\n'So I am, but I like one at a time. This is too miscellaneous and\\ncrowded.'\\n\\n'Some women are never satisfied. It's very rude and ungrateful to the\\npoor old man, who meant to be nice, no doubt, and to show his respect\\nfor Englishwomen. I think you ought to write and thank him,' said\\nBruce. 'And let me see the letter before it goes.'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nCoup de Foudre\\n\\nWhen Aylmer Ross got back to the little brown house in Jermyn Street he\\nwent to his library, and took from a certain drawer an ivory miniature\\nframed in black. He looked at it for some time. It had a sweet,\\nold-fashioned face, with a very high forehead, blue eyes, and dark hair\\narranged in two festoons of plaits, turned up at the sides. It\\nrepresented his mother in the early sixties and he thought it was like\\nEdith. He had a great devotion and cult for the memory of his mother.\\nWhen he was charmed with a woman he always imagined her to be like his\\nmother.\\n\\nHe had never thought this about his wife People had said how\\nextraordinarily Aylmer must have been in love to have married that\\nuninteresting girl, no-one in particular, not pretty and a little\\nsecond-rate. As a matter of fact the marriage had happened entirely by\\naccident. It had occurred through a misunderstanding during a game of\\nconsequences in a country house. She was terribly literal. Having taken\\nsome joke of his seriously, she had sent him a touchingly coy letter\\nsaying she was overwhelmed at his offer (feeling she was hardly worthy\\nto be his wife) and must think it over. He did not like to hurt her\\nfeelings by explaining, and when she relented and accepted him he\\ncouldn't bear to tell her the truth. He was absurdly tender-hearted,\\nand he thought that, after all, it didn't matter so very much. The\\nlittle house left him by his mother needed a mistress; he would\\nprobably marry somebody or other, anyhow; and she seemed such a\\nharmless little thing. It would please her so much! When the hurried\\nmarriage had come to a pathetic end by her early death everyone was\\ntragic about it except Aylmer. All his friends declared he was\\nheart-broken and lonely and would never marry again. He had indeed been\\nshocked and grieved at her death, but only for her--not at being left\\nalone. That part, was a relief. The poor little late Mrs Aylmer Ross\\nhad turned out a terrible mistake. She had said the wrong thing from\\nmorning till night, and, combining a prim, refined manner with a vulgar\\npoint of view, had been in every way dreadfully impossible. He had\\nreally been patience and unselfishness itself to her, but he had\\nsuffered. The fact was, he had never even liked her. That was the\\nreason he had not married again.\\n\\nBut he was devoted to his boy in a quiet way. He was the sort of man\\nwho is adored by children, animals, servants and women. Tall, strong\\nand handsome, with intelligence beyond the average, yet with nothing\\nalarming about him, good-humoured about trifles, jealous in matters of\\nlove--perhaps that is, after all, the type women really like best. It\\nis sheer nonsense to say that women enjoy being tyrannised over. No\\ndoubt there are some who would rather be bullied than ignored. But the\\nhectoring man is, with few exceptions, secretly detested. In so far as\\none can generalise (always a dangerous thing to do) it may be said that\\nwomen like best a kind, clever man who can be always trusted; and\\noccasionally (if necessary) deceived.\\n\\nAylmer hardly ever got angry except in an argument about ideas. Yet his\\nfeelings were violent; he was impulsive, and under his suave and\\neasy-going manner emotional. He was certainly good-looking, but had he\\nnot been he would have pleased all the same. He seemed to radiate\\nwarmth, life, a certain careless good-humour. To be near him was like\\nwarming one's hands at a warm fire. Superficially susceptible and\\ninclined to be experimental he had not the instinct of the collector\\nand was devoid of fatuousness. But he could have had more genuine\\nsuccesses than all the Don Juans and Romeos and Fausts who ever climbed\\nrope ladders. Besides his physical attraction he inspired a feeling of\\nreliance. Women felt safe with him; he would never treat anyone badly.\\nHe inspired that kind of trust enormously in men also, and his house\\nwas constantly filled with people asking his advice and begging him to\\ndo things--sometimes not very easy ones. He was always being left\\nguardian to young persons who would never require one, and said himself\\nhe had become almost a professional trustee.\\n\\nAs Aylmer was generous and very extravagant in a way of his own (though\\nhe cared nothing for show), he really worked hard at the bar to add to\\nhis already large income. He always wanted a great deal of money. He\\nrequired ease, margin and elbow-room. He had no special hobbies, but he\\nneeded luxury in general of a kind, and especially the luxury of\\ngetting things in a hurry, his theory being that everything comes to\\nthe man who won't wait. He was not above detesting little material\\nhardships. He was not the sort of man, for instance, even in his\\nyoungest days, who would go by omnibus to the gallery to the opera, to\\nhear a favourite singer or a special performance; not that he had the\\nfaintest tinge of snobbishness, but simply because such trifling\\ndrawbacks irritated him, and spoilt his pleasure.\\n\\nImpressionistic as he was in life, on the other hand, curiously,\\nAylmer's real taste in art and decoration was Pre-Raphaelite;\\ndelicate, detailed and meticulous almost to preciousness. He often had\\ndelightful things in his house, but never for long. He had no pleasure\\nin property; valuable possessions worried him, and after any amount of\\ntrouble to get some object of art he would often give it away the next\\nweek. For he really liked money only for freedom and ease. The general\\nlook of the house was, consequently, distinguished, sincere and\\nextremely comfortable. It was neither hackneyed nor bizarre, and, while\\nit contained some interesting things, had no superfluities.\\n\\nAylmer had been spoilt as a boy and was still wilful and a little\\nimpatient. For instance he could never wait even for a boy-messenger,\\nbut always sent his notes by taxi to wait for an answer. And now he\\nwanted something in a hurry, and was very much afraid he would never\\nget it.\\n\\nAylmer was, as I have said, often a little susceptible. This time he\\nfelt completely bowled over. He had only seen her twice. That made no\\ndifference.\\n\\nThe truth was--it sounds romantic, but is really scientific, all\\nromance being, perhaps, based on science--that Edith's appearance\\ncorresponded in every particular with an ideal that had grown up with\\nhim. Whether he had seen some picture as a child that had left a vague\\nand lasting impression, or whatever the reason was, the moment he saw\\nher he felt, with a curious mental sensation, as of something that fell\\ninto its place with a click ('Ca y est!'), that she realised some\\nhalf-forgotten dream. In fact, it was a rare and genuine case of _coup\\nde foudre_. Had she been a girl he would have proposed to her the next\\nday, and they might quite possibly have married in a month, and lived\\nhappily ever after. These things occasionally happen. But she was\\nmarried already.\\n\\nHad she been a fool, or a bore, a silly little idiot or a fisher of\\nmen, a social sham who prattled of duchesses or a strenuous feminine\\npolitician who babbled of votes; a Christian Scientist bent on\\nconverting, an adventuress without adventures (the worst kind), a\\nmind-healer or a body-snatcher, a hockey-player or even a lady\\nnovelist, it would have been exactly the same; whatever she had been,\\nmentally or morally, he would undoubtedly have fallen in love with her\\nphysically, at first sight. But it was very much worse than that. He\\nfound her delightful, and clever; he was certain she was an angel. She\\nwas married to Ottley. Ottley was all right.... Rather an ass ...\\nrather ridiculous; apparently in every way but one.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSo absurdly hard hit was Aylmer that it seemed to him as if to see her\\nagain as soon as possible was already the sole object in his life. Did\\nshe like him? Intuitively he felt that during his little visit his\\nintense feeling had radiated, and not displeased--perhaps a little\\nimpressed--her. He could easily, he knew, form a friendship with them;\\narrange to see her often. He was going to meet her tonight, through his\\nown arrangement. He would get them to come and dine with him soon--no,\\nthe next day.\\n\\nWhat was the good?\\n\\nWell, where was the harm?\\n\\nAylmer had about the same code of morals as the best of his numerous\\nfriends in Bohemia, in clubland and in social London. He was no more\\nscrupulous on most subjects than the ordinary man of his own class.\\nStill, _he had been married himself_. That made an immense difference,\\nfor he was positively capable of seeing (and with sympathy) from the\\nhusband's point of view. Even now, indifferent as he had been to his\\nown wife, and after ten years, it would have caused him pain and fury\\nhad he found out that she had ever tried to play him false. Of course,\\ncases varied. He knew that if Edith had been free his one thought would\\nhave been to marry her. Had she been different, and differently placed,\\nhe would have blindly tried for anything he could get, in any possible\\nway. But, as she was?... He felt convinced he could never succeed in\\nmaking her care for him; there was not the slightest chance of it. And,\\nsupposing even that he could? And here came in the delicacy and scruple\\nof the man who had been married himself. He thought he wouldn't even\\nwish to spoil, by the vulgarity of compromising, or by the shadow of a\\nsecret, the serenity of her face, the gay prettiness of that life. No,\\nhe wouldn't if he could. And yet how exciting it would be to rouse her\\nfrom that cool composure. She was rather enigmatic. But he thought she\\ncould be roused. And she was so clever. How well she would carry it\\noff! How she would never bore a man! And he suddenly imagined a day\\nwith her in the country.... Then he thought that his imagination was\\nflying on far too fast. He decided not to be a hopeless fool, but just\\nto go ahead, and talk to her, and get to know her; not to think too\\nmuch about her. She needn't even know how he felt. To idolise her from\\na distance would be quite delightful enough. When a passion is not\\nrealised, he thought, it fades away, or becomes ideal worship\\n--Dante--Petrarch--that sort of thing! It could never fade away\\nin this case, he was sure. How pretty she was, how lovely her mouth was\\nwhen she smiled! She had no prejudices, apparently; no affectations;\\nhow she played and sang that song again when he asked her! With what a\\ndelightful sense of humour she had dealt with him, and also with Bruce,\\nat the Mitchells. Ottley must be a little difficult sometimes. She had\\nread and thought; she had the same tastes as he. He wondered if she\\nwould have liked that thing in _The Academy_, on Gardens, that he had\\njust read. He began looking for it. He thought he would send it to her,\\nasking her opinion; then he would get an answer, and see her\\nhandwriting. You don't know a woman until you have had a letter from\\nher.\\n\\nBut no--what a fool he would look! Besides he was going to see her\\ntonight. It was about time to get ready.... Knowing subconsciously that\\nhe had made some slight favourable impression--at any rate that he\\nhadn't repelled or bored her--he dressed with all the anxiety, joy and\\nthrills of excitement of a boy of twenty; and no boy of twenty can ever\\nfeel these things as keenly or half as elaborately as a man nearly\\ntwice that age, since all the added experiences, disillusions,\\npractice, knowledge and life of the additional years help to form a\\npart of the same emotion, making it infinitely deeper, and all the\\nstronger because so much more _averti_ and conscious of itself.\\n\\nHe seemed so nervous while dressing that Soames, the valet, to whom he\\nwas a hero, ventured respectfully to hope there was nothing wrong.\\n\\n'No. I'm all right,' said Aylmer. 'I'm never ill. I think, Soames, I\\nshall probably die of middle age.'\\n\\nHe went out laughing, leaving the valet smiling coldly out of\\npoliteness.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSoames never understood any kind of jest. He took himself and everyone\\nelse seriously. But he already knew perfectly well that his master had\\nfallen in love last night, and he disapproved very strongly. He thought\\nall that sort of thing ought to be put a stop to.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nArchie's Essay\\n\\n'Mrs Ottley,' said Miss Townsend,' do you mind looking at this essay of\\nArchie's? I really don't know what to think of it. I think it shows\\ntalent, except the spelling. But it's _very_ naughty of him to have\\nwritten what is at the end.'\\n\\nEdith took the paper and read:\\n\\n'TRAYS OF CHARACTER\\n\\ntrays of character will always show threw how ever much you may polish\\nit up trays of character will always show threw the grane of the wood.\\n\\nA burd will keep on singing because he wants to and they can't help\\ndoing what it wants this is instinkt. and it is the same with trays of\\ncharicter. having thus shown my theory that trays of carocter will\\nalways show threw in spite of all trubble and in any circemstances\\nwhatever I will conclude Archibald Bruce Ottley please t.o.'\\n\\nOn the other side of the paper was written very neatly, still in\\nArchie's writing:\\n\\n'3 LINDEN MANSIONS, CADOGAN SQUARE, KNIGHTSBRIDGE. _Second Floor_\\n\\n1. Mr Bruce Ottley (FO) 2. Mrs Bruce Ottley 3. Master Archibald Bruce\\nOttley 4. Little _beast_ 5. Mary Johnson housemaid 6. Miss Thrupp Cook\\n7. Marie maid\\n\\n8. Dorothy Margaret Miss Townsend governess 9. Ellen Maud Parrot\\nnurse.'\\n\\n'Do you see?' said Miss Townsend. 'It's his way of slyly calling poor\\nDilly a beast, because he's angry with her. Isn't it a shame? What\\nshall I do?' Both of them laughed and enjoyed it.\\n\\n'Archie, what is the meaning of this? Why did you make this census of\\nyour home?' Edith asked him gently.\\n\\n'Why, I didn't make senses of my home; I just wrote down who lived\\nhere.'\\n\\nEdith looked at him reproachfully.\\n\\n'Well, I didn't call Dilly a beast. I haven't broken Miss Townsend's\\nrules. She made a new rule I wasn't to call her a beast before\\nbreakfast--'\\n\\n'What, you're allowed to call her these awful names after breakfast?'\\n\\n'No. She made a rule before breakfast I wasn't to call Dilly a beast,\\nand I haven't. How did you know it meant her anyway? It might have\\nmeant somebody else.'\\n\\n'That's prevaricating; it's mean--not like you, Archie.'\\n\\n'Well, I never called her a beast. No-one can say I did. And besides,\\nanybody would have called her a beast after how she went on.'\\n\\n'What are you angry with the child for?'\\n\\n'Oh, she bothers so. The moment I imitate the man with the German\\naccent she begins to cry. She says she doesn't like me to do it. She\\nsays she can't bear me to. Then she goes and tells Miss Townsend I\\nslapped her, and Miss Townsend blames me.'\\n\\n'Then you shouldn't have slapped her; it was horrid of you; you ought\\nto remember she's a little girl and weaker than you.'\\n\\n'I did remember...'\\n\\n'Oh, Archie!'\\n\\n'Well, I'll make it up if she begs my pardon; not unless she does I\\nsha'n't,' said Archie magnanimously.\\n\\n'I shall certainly not allow her to do anything of the kind.'\\n\\nAt this moment Dilly came in, with her finger in her tiny mouth, and\\nwent up to Archie, drawling with a pout, and in a whining voice:\\n\\n'I didn't mean to.'\\n\\nArchie beamed at once.\\n\\n'That's all right, Dilly,' he said forgivingly.\\n\\nThen he turned to his mother.\\n\\n'Mother, have you got that paper?'\\n\\n'Yes, I have indeed!'\\n\\n'Well, cross out--that, and put in Aspasia Matilda Ottley. Sorry,\\nDilly!' He kissed her, and they ran off together hand in hand; looking\\nlike cherubs, and laughing musically.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nAylmer\\n\\nAt the Carlton Aylmer had easily persuaded Bruce and Edith to dine with\\nhim next day, although they were engaged to the elder Mrs Ottley\\nalready. He said he expected two or three friends, and he convinced\\nthem they must come too. It is only in London that people meet for the\\nfirst time at a friend's house, and then, if they take to each other,\\npractically live together for weeks after. No matter what social\\nengagements they may happen to have, these are all thrown aside for the\\nnew friend. London people, with all their correctness, are really more\\nunconventional than any other people in the world. For instance, in\\nParis such a thing could never happen in any kind of _monde_, unless,\\nperhaps, it were among artists and Bohemians; and even then it would be\\ntheir great object to prove to one another that they were not wanting\\nin distractions and were very much in demand; the lady, especially,\\nwould make the man wait for an opportunity of seeing her again, from\\ncalculation, to make herself seem of more value. Such second-rate\\nsolicitudes would never even occur to Edith. But she had a scruple\\nabout throwing over old Mrs Ottley.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n'Won't your mother be disappointed?' Edith asked.\\n\\n'My dear Edith, you can safely leave that to me. Of course she'll be\\ndisappointed, but you can go round and see her, and speak to her nicely\\nand tell her that after all we can't come because we've got another\\nengagement.'\\n\\n'And am I to tell her it's a subsequent one? Otherwise she'll wonder we\\ndidn't mention it before.'\\n\\n'Don't be in a hurry, dear. Don't rush things; remember... she's my\\nmother. Perhaps to you, Edith, it seems a rather old-fashioned idea,\\nand I daresay you think it's rot, but to me there's something very\\nsacred about the idea of a mother.' He lit a cigarette and looked in\\nthe glass.\\n\\n'Yes, dear. Then, don't you think we really ought to have kept our\\npromise to dine with her? She'll probably be looking forward to it. I\\ndaresay she's asked one or two people she thinks we like, to meet us.'\\n\\n'Circumstances alter cases, Edith. If it comes to that, Aylmer Ross has\\ngot two or three people coming to dine with him whom he thinks we might\\nlike. He said so himself. That's why he's asked us.'\\n\\n'Yes, but he can't have asked them on purpose, Bruce, because, you see,\\nwe didn't know him on Thursday.'\\n\\n'Well, why should he have asked them on purpose? _How_ you argue! _How_\\nyou go on! It really seems to me you're getting absurdly exacting and\\ntouchy, Edith dear. I believe all those flowers from the embassy have\\npositively turned your head. _Why_ should he have asked them on\\npurpose. You admit yourself that we didn't even know the man last\\nThursday, and yet you expect--' Bruce stopped. He had got into a slight\\ntangle.\\n\\nEdith looked away. She had not quite mastered the art of the inward\\nsmile.\\n\\n'Far better, in my opinion,' continued Bruce, walking up and down the\\nroom.--'Now, don't interrupt me in your impulsive way, but hear me\\nout--it would be far more kind and sensible in every way for you to sit\\nright down at that little writing-table, take out your stylographic pen\\nand write and tell my mother that I have a bad attack of influenza....\\nYes; one should always be considerate to one's parents. I suppose it\\nreally is the way I was brought up that makes me feel this so keenly,'\\nhe explained.\\n\\nEdith sat down to the writing-table. 'How bad is your influenza?'\\n\\n'Oh, not very bad; because it would worry her: a slight attack.--Stop!\\nNot so very slight--we must let her think it's the ordinary kind, and\\nthen she'll think it's catching and she won't come here for a few days,\\nand that will avoid our going into the matter in detail, which would be\\nbetter.'\\n\\n'If she thinks it's catching, dear, she'll want Archie and Dilly, and\\nMiss Townsend and Nurse to go and stay with her in South Kensington,\\nand that will be quite an affair.'\\n\\n'Right as usual; very thoughtful of you; you're a clever little woman\\nsometimes, Edith. Wait!'--he put up his hand with a gesture frequent\\nwith him, like a policeman stopping the traffic at Hyde Park Corner.\\n'Wait!--leave out the influenza altogether, and just say I've caught a\\nslight chill.'\\n\\n'Yes. Then she'll come over at once, and you'll have to go to bed.'\\n\\n'My dear Edith,' said Bruce, 'you're over-anxious; I shall do nothing\\nof the kind. There's no need that I should be laid up for this. It's\\nnot serious.'\\n\\nHe was beginning to believe in his own illness, as usual.\\n\\n'Air! (I want to go round to the club)--tonic treatment!--that's the\\nthing!--that's often the very best thing for a chill--this sort of\\nchill.... Ah, that will do very nicely. Very neatly written....\\nGood-bye, dear.'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs soon as Bruce had gone out Edith rang up the elder Mrs Ottley on the\\ntelephone, and relieved her anxiety in advance. They were great\\nfriends; the sense of humour possessed by her mother-in-law took the\\nsting out of the relationship.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe dinner at Aylmer's house was a great success. Bruce enjoyed himself\\nenormously, for he liked nothing better in the world than to give his\\nopinion. And Aylmer was specially anxious for his view as to the\\nauthenticity of a little Old Master he had acquired, and took notes,\\nalso, of a word of advice with regard to electric lighting, admitting\\nhe was not a very practical man, and Bruce evidently was.\\n\\nEdith was interested and pleased to go to the house of her new friend\\nand to reconstruct the scene as it must have been when Mrs Aylmer Ross\\nhad been there.\\n\\nFreddy, the boy, was at school, but there was a portrait of him.\\nEvidently he resembled his father. The sketch represented him with the\\nsame broad forehead, smooth, dense light hair, pale blue eyes under\\neyebrows with a slight frown in them, and the charming mouth rather\\nfully curved, expressing an amiable and pleasure-loving nature. The boy\\nwas good-looking, but not, Edith thought, as handsome as Aylmer.\\n\\nThe only other woman present was Lady Everard, a plump, talkative,\\nmiddle-aged woman in black; the smiling widow of Lord Everard, and well\\nknown for her lavish musical hospitality and her vague and\\nindiscriminate good nature. She bristled with aigrettes and sparkled\\nwith diamonds and determination. She was marvellously garrulous about\\nnothing in particular. She was a woman who never stopped talking for a\\nsingle moment, but in a way that resembled leaking rather than laying\\ndown the law. Tepidly, indifferently and rather amusingly she prattled\\non without ceasing, on every subject under the sun, and was socially a\\nvaluable help because where she was there was never an awkward\\npause--or any other kind.\\n\\nVincy was there and young Cricker, whose occasional depressed silences\\nwere alternated with what he called a certain amount of sparkling\\nchaff.\\n\\nLady Everard told Edith that she felt quite like a sort of mother to\\nAylmer.\\n\\n'Don't you think it's sad, Mrs Ottley,' she said, when they were alone,\\n'to think that the dear fellow has no wife to look after this dear\\nlittle house? It always seems to me such a pity, but still, I always\\nsay, at any rate Aylmer's married once, and that's more than most of\\nthem do nowadays. It's simply horse's work to get them to do it at all.\\nSometimes I think it's perfectly disgraceful. And yet I can't help\\nseeing how sensible it is of them too; you know, when you think of it,\\nwhat with one thing and another, what does a man of the present day\\nneed a wife for? What with the flats, where everything on earth is done\\nfor them, and the kindness of friends--just think how bachelors are\\nspoilt by their married friends!--and their clubs, and the frightful\\nexpense of everything, it seems to me, as a general rule, that the\\naverage man must be madly unselfish or a perfect idiot to marry at\\nall--that's what it seems to me--don't you? When you think of all the\\nresponsibilities they take upon themselves!--and I'm sure there are not\\nmany modern wives who expect to do anything on earth but have their\\nbills and bridge debts paid, and their perpetual young men asked to\\ndinner, and one thing and another. Of course, though, there are some\\nexceptions.' She smiled amiably. 'Aylmer tells me you have two\\nchildren; very sweet of you, I'm sure. What darling pets they must be!\\nAngels!--Angels! Oh, I'm so fond of children! But, particularly--isn't\\nit funny?--when they're not there, because I can't stand their noise.\\nNow my little grandchildren--my daughter Eva's been married ten\\nyears--Lady Lindley, you know--hers are perfect pets and heavenly\\nangels, but I can't stand them for more than a few minutes at a time. I\\nhave nerves, so much so, do you know (partly because I go in a good\\ndeal for music and intellect and so on), so much so, that I very nearly\\nhad a rest cure at the end of last season, and I should have had,\\nprobably, but that new young French singer came over with a letter of\\nintroduction to me, and of course I couldn't desert him, but had to do\\nmy very best. Ever heard him sing? Yes, you would, of course. Oh, how\\nwonderful it is!'\\n\\nEdith waited in vain for a pause to say she didn't know the name of the\\nsinger. Lady Everard went on, leaning comfortably back in Aylmer's\\narm-chair.\\n\\n'Willie Cricker dances very prettily, too; he came to one of my\\nevenings and had quite a success. Only an amateur, of course; but\\nrather nice. However, like all amateurs he wants to perform only when\\npeople would rather he didn't, and when they want him to he won't; he\\nrefuses. That's the amateur all over. The professional comes up to the\\nscratch when wanted and stops when the performance is not required.\\nIt's all the difference in the world, isn't it, Mrs Ottley? Still, he's\\na nice boy. Are you fond of music?'\\n\\n'Very. Really fond of it; but I'm only a listener.'\\n\\nLady Everard seemed delighted and brightened up.\\n\\n'Oh, you don't sing or play?--you must come to one of my Musical\\nEvenings. We have all the stars in the season at times--dear Melba and\\nCaruso--and darling Bemberk and dear Debussy! Oh! don't laugh at my\\nenthusiasm, my dear; but I'm quite music-mad--and then, of course, we\\nhave any amount of amateurs, and all the new young professionals that\\nare coming on. In my opinion Paul La France, that's the young man I was\\ntelling you about, will be one of the very very best--quite at the top\\nof the tree, and I'm determined he shall. But of course, he needs care\\nand encouragement. I think of his giving a _Conference_, in which he'll\\nlecture on his own singing. I shall be on the platform to make a sort\\nof introductory speech and Monti, of course, will accompany. He is the\\nonly accompanist that counts. But then I suppose he's been accompanying\\nsomebody or other ever since he was a little boy, so it's second nature\\nto him. And you must come, and bring your husband. Does he go with you\\nto places? Very nice of him. Nowadays if husbands and wives don't\\noccasionally go to the same parties they have hardly any opportunity of\\nmeeting at all; that's what I always say. But then, of course, _you're_\\nstill almost on your honeymoon, aren't you? Charming!'\\n\\nIn the dining-room Cricker was confiding in Aylmer, while Vincy and\\nBruce discussed the Old Master.\\n\\n'Awful, you know,' Cricker said, in a low voice--' this girl's mania\\nfor me! I get wires and telephones all day long; she hardly gives me\\ntime to shave. And she's jolly pretty, so I don't like to chuck it; in\\nfact, I daren't. But her one cry is 'Cold; cold; cold!' She says I'm as\\ncold as a stone. What do you thing of that?'\\n\\n'You may be a stone, and a rolling one at that, said Aylmer, 'but there\\nare other pebbles on the beach, I daresay.'\\n\\n'I bet not one of them as stony as I am!' cried Cricker.\\n\\nCricker came a little nearer, lowering his voice again.\\n\\n'It's a very peculiar case,' he said proudly.\\n\\n'Of course; it always is.'\\n\\n'You see, she's frightfully pretty, on the stage, and married! One of\\nthe most awkward positions a person can be in. Mind you, I'm sorry for\\nher. I thought of consulting you about something if you'll give me a\\nminute or two, old chap.'\\n\\nHe took out a letter-case.\\n\\n'I don't mean Ill show you this--oh no, I can't show it--it isn't\\ncompromising.'\\n\\n'Of course not. No-one really likes to show a really lukewarm love\\nletter. Besides it would hardly be--'\\n\\nCricker put the case back.\\n\\nMy dear chap! I wasn't going to show it to you--I shouldn't dream of\\nsuch a thing--to anybody; but I was just going to read you out a\\nsentence from which you can form an opinion of my predicament. It's no\\ngood mincing matters, old boy, the woman is crazy mad about me--there\\nyou've got it straight--in a nutshell.--Crazy!'\\n\\n'She certainly can't be very sane,' returned Aylmer.\\n\\nBefore the end of the evening Aylmer had arranged to take the Ottleys\\nto see a play that was having a run. After this he dropped in to tea to\\ndiscuss it and Bruce kept him to dinner.\\n\\nDay after day went on, and they saw him continually. He had never shown\\nby word or manner any more of his sentiment than on the second occasion\\nwhen they had met but Edith was growing thoroughly accustomed to this\\nnew interest, and it certainly gave a zest to her existence, for she\\nknew, as women do know, or at any rate she believed, that she had an\\nattraction for him, which he didn't intend to give away. The situation\\nwas pleasant and notwithstanding Vincy's slight anxiety, she persisted\\nin seeing nothing in it to fear in any way. Aylmer didn't even flirt.\\n\\nOne day, at Vincy's rooms, she thought he seemed different.\\n\\nVincy, with all his gentle manner, had in art an extraordinary taste\\nfor brutality and violence, and his rooms were covered with pictures by\\nFuturists and Cubists, wild studies by wild men from Tahiti and a\\ncurious collection of savage ornaments and weapons.\\n\\n'I don't quite see Vincy handling that double-edged Chinese sword, do\\nyou? said Aylmer, laughing.\\n\\n'No, nor do I; but I do like to look at it,' Vincy said.\\n\\nThey went into the little dining-room, which was curiously furnished\\nwith a green marble dining-table, narrow, as in the pictures of the\\nLast Supper, at which the guests could sit on one side only to be\\nwaited on from the other. On it as decoration (it was laid for two,\\nside by side) were some curious straw mats, a few laurel leaves, a\\nlittle marble statuette of Pan, and three Tangerine oranges.\\n\\n'Oh, Vincy, do tell me--what are you going to eat tonight?' Edith\\nexclaimed. 'Unless you're with other people I can never imagine you\\nsitting down to a proper meal.'\\n\\nEat? Oh a nice orange, I think,' said he. Sometimes when I'm alone I\\njust have a nice egg and a glass of water, I do myself very well. Don't\\nworry about me, Edith.'\\n\\nWhen they were alone for a moment Aylmer looked out of the window. It\\nwas rather high up, and they looked down on the hustling crowds of\\npeople pushing along through the warm air in Victoria Street.\\n\\n'It's getting decent weather,' he said.\\n\\n'Yes, quite warm.'\\n\\nThey always suddenly talked commonplaces when they were first left\\nalone.\\n\\n'I may be going away pretty soon,' he said.\\n\\n'Going away! Oh, where?'\\n\\n'I'm not quite sure yet.'\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n'Well, you'll come to tea tomorrow, won't you? said Edith. 'Yes,\\nindeed, thank you--thank you so much. I shall look forward to it. At\\nfive?' He spoke formally.\\n\\n'At four,' said Edith.\\n\\n'I shall be lunching not very far from you tomorrow.'\\n\\n'At a quarter to four,' said Edith.\\n\\n'I wonder who this other place is laid for,' said Aylmer, looking at\\nthe table.\\n\\n'How indiscreet of you! So do I. One must find out.'\\n\\n'How? By asking?'\\n\\n'Good heavens, no!' cried Edith. 'What an extraordinary idea!'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nShopping Chez Soi\\n\\nEdith was expecting Aylmer to call that afternoon before he went away.\\nShe was surprised to find how perturbed she was at the idea of his\\ngoing away. He had become almost a part of their daily existence, and\\nseeing him was certainly quite the most amusing and exciting experience\\nshe had ever had. And now it was coming to an end. Some obscure\\nclairvoyance told her that his leaving and telling her of it in this\\nvague way had some reference to her; but perhaps (she thought) she was\\nwrong; perhaps it was simply that, after the pleasant intercourse and\\nsemi-intimacy of the last few weeks, he was going to something that\\ninterested him more? He was a widower; and still a young man. Perhaps\\nhe was in love with someone. This idea was far from agreeable, although\\nexcept the first and second time they met he had never said a word that\\ncould be described even as flirtation. He showed admiration for her,\\nand pleasure in her society, but he rarely saw her alone. The few\\nvisits and _tete-a-tetes_ had always begun by conventional commonplace\\nphrases and embarrassment, and had ended in a delightful sympathy, in\\nanimated conversation, in a flowing confidence and gaiety, and in long\\ndiscussions on books, and art, and principally people. That was all. In\\nfact he had become, in two or three weeks, in a sense _l'ami de la\\nmaison_; they went everywhere with him and met nearly every day, and\\nBruce appeared to adore him. It was entirely different from her long\\nand really intimate friendship with Vincy. Vincy was her confidant, her\\nfriend. She could tell _him_ everything, and she did, and he confided\\nin her and told her all except one side of his life, of which she was\\naware, but to which she never referred. This was his secret romance\\nwith a certain girl artist of whom he never spoke, although Edith knew\\nthat some day he would tell her about that also.\\n\\nBut with Aylmer there was, and would always be, less real freedom and\\nimpersonal frankness, because there was so much more selfconsciousness;\\nin fact because there was an unacknowledged but very strong mutual\\nphysical attraction. Edith had, however, felt until now merely the\\nagreeable excitement of knowing that a man she liked, and in whom she\\nwas immensely interested, was growing apparently devoted to her, while\\n_she_ had always believed that she would know how to deal with the case\\nin such a way that it could never lead to anything more--that is to\\nsay, to more than _she_ wished.\\n\\nAnd now, he was going away. Why? And where? However, the first thing to\\nconsider was that she would see him today. The result of this\\nconsideration was the obvious one. She must do some shopping.\\n\\nEdith was remarkably feminine in every attribute, in manner, in\\nmovement and in appearance; indeed, for a woman of the present day\\nunusually and refreshingly feminine. Yet she had certain mental\\ncharacteristics which were entirely unlike most women. One was her\\nextreme aversion for shops, and indeed for going into any concrete\\nlittle details. It has been said that her feeling for dress was sure\\nand unerring. But it was entirely that of the artist; it was\\nimpressionistic. Edith was very clever, indeed, most ingenious, in\\nmanaging practical affairs, as long as she was the director, the\\ngeneral of the campaign. But she did not like carrying out in detail\\nher plans. She liked to be the architect, not the workman.\\n\\nFor example, the small household affairs in the flat went on wheels;\\neverything was almost always perfect. But Edith did not rattle her\\nhousekeeping keys, or count the coals, nor did she even go through\\naccounts, or into the kitchen every day. The secret was simple. She had\\na good cook and housekeeper, who managed all these important but\\ntedious details admirably, under her suggestions. In order to do this\\nEdith had to practise a little fraud on Bruce, a justifiable and quite\\nunselfish one. She gave the cook and housekeeper a quarter of her dress\\nallowance, in addition to the wages Bruce considered sufficient;\\nbecause Bruce believed that they could not afford more than a certain\\namount for a cook, while he admitted that Edith, who had a few hundred\\npounds a year of her own, might need to spend this on dress. Very\\nlittle of it went on dress, although Edith was not very economical. But\\nshe had a plan of her own; she knew that to be dressed in a very\\nordinary style (that is to say, simple, conventional, comme il faut)\\nsuited her, by throwing her unusual beauty into relief. Occasionally a\\ntouch of individuality was added, when she wanted to have a special\\neffect. But she never entered a shop; very rarely interviewed a\\nmilliner. It was always done for her. She was easy to dress, being\\ntall, slim and remarkably pretty. She thought that most women make a\\ngreat mistake in allowing dress to be the master instead of the servant\\nof their good looks; many women were, she considered, entirely crushed\\nand made insignificant by the beauty of their clothes. The important\\nthing was to have a distinguished appearance, and this cannot, of\\ncourse, easily be obtained without expensive elegance. But Edith was\\ntwenty-eight, and looked younger, so she could dress simply.\\n\\nThis morning Edith had telephoned to her friend, Miss Bennett, an old\\nschoolfellow who had nothing to do, and adored commissions. Edith,\\nsitting by the fire or at the 'phone, gave her orders, which were\\nalways decisive, short and yet meticulous. Miss Bennett was a little\\nlate this morning, and Edith had been getting quite anxious to see her.\\nWhen she at last arrived--she was a nondescript-looking girl, with a\\nsmall hat squashed on her head, a serge coat and skirt, black gloves\\nand shoes with spats--Edith greeted her rather reproachfully with:\\n\\n'You're late, Grace.'\\n\\n'Sorry,' said Grace.\\n\\nThe name suited her singularly badly. She was plain, but had a pleasant\\nface, a pink complexion, small bright eyes, protruding teeth and a\\nscenario for a figure, merely a collection of bones on which a dress\\ncould be hung. She was devoted to Edith, and to a few other friends of\\nboth sexes, of whom she made idols. She was hard, abrupt, enthusiastic,\\nignorant and humorous.\\n\\n'Sorry, but I had to do a lot of--'\\n\\n'All right,' interrupted Edith. 'You couldn't help it. Listen' to what\\nI want you to do.'\\n\\n'Go ahead,' said Miss Bennett, taking out a note-book and pencil.\\n\\nEdith spoke in her low, soft, impressive voice, rather slowly.\\n\\n'Go anywhere you like and bring me back two or three perfectly simple\\ntea-gowns--you know the sort of shape, rather like evening\\ncloaks--straight lines--none of the new draperies and curves--in red,\\nblue and black.'\\n\\n'On appro.?' asked Miss Bennett.\\n\\n'On anything you like, but made of Liberty satin, with a dull surface.'\\n\\n'There's no such thing.' Grace Bennett laughed. 'You mean charmeuse, or\\ncrepe-de-chine, perhaps?'\\n\\n'Call it what you like, only get it. You must bring them back in a\\ntaxi.'\\n\\n'Extravagant girl!'\\n\\n'They're not to cost more than--oh! not much,' added Edith, 'at the\\nmost.'\\n\\n'Economical woman! Why not have a really good tea-gown while you're\\nabout it?'\\n\\n'These _will_ be good. I want to have a hard outline like a\\nFergusson.'\\n\\n'Oh, really? What's that?'\\n\\n'Never mind. And suppose you can't get the shape, Grace.'\\n\\n'Yes?'\\n\\n'Bring some evening cloaks--the kimonoish kind--I could wear one over a\\nlace blouse; it would look exactly the same.'\\n\\n'Edith, what curious ideas you have! But you're right enough. Anything\\nelse?' said Miss Bennett, standing up, ready to go. 'I like shopping\\nfor you. You know what you want.'\\n\\n'Buy me an azalea, not a large one, and a bit of some dull material of\\nthe same colour to drape round it.'\\n\\n'How extraordinary it is the way you hate anything shiny!' exclaimed\\nMiss Bennett, making a note.\\n\\n'I know; I only like _mat_ effects. Oh, and in case I choose a\\nlight-coloured gown, get me just one very large black velvet orchid,\\ntoo.'\\n\\n'Right. That all?'\\n\\nEdith looked at her shoes; they were perfect, tiny, pointed and made of\\nblack suede. She decided they would do.\\n\\n'Yes, that's all, dear.'\\n\\n'And might I kindly ask,' said Miss Bennett, getting up, 'any\\nparticular reason for all this? Are you going to have the flu, or a\\nparty, or what?'\\n\\n'No,' said Edith, who was always frank when it was possible. 'I'm\\nexpecting a visitor who's never seen me in anything but a coat and\\nskirt, or in evening dress.'\\n\\n'Oh! He wants a change, does he?'\\n\\n'Don't be vulgar, Grace. Thanks awfully, dear. You're really kind.'\\n\\nThey both laughed, and Edith gently pushed her friend out of the room.\\nThen she sat down on a sofa, put up her feet, and began to read\\n_Rhythm_ to divert her thoughts. Vincy had brought it to convert her to\\nPost-Impressionism.\\n\\nWhen Archie and Dilly were out, and Edith, who always got up rather\\nearly, was alone, she often passed her morning hours in reading,\\ndreaming, playing the piano, or even in thinking. She was one of the\\nfew women who really can think, and enjoy it. This morning she soon put\\ndown the mad clever little prophetic Oxford journal. Considering she\\nwas usually the most reposeful woman in London, she was rather restless\\ntoday. She glanced round the little room; there was nothing in it to\\ndistract or irritate, or even to suggest a train of thought; except\\nperhaps the books; everything was calming and soothing, with a touch of\\ngaiety in the lightness of the wall decorations. An azalea, certainly,\\nwould be a good note. The carpet, and almost everything in the room,\\nwas green, except the small white enamelled piano. Today she felt that\\nshe wanted to use all her influence to get Aylmer to confide in her\\nmore. Perhaps he was slipping away from her--she would have been only a\\nlittle incident in his existence--while she certainly wished it to go\\non. Seeing this, perhaps it oughtn't to go on. She wondered if he would\\nlaugh or be serious today... whether...\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nMiss Bennett had come up in the lift with a heap of cardboard boxes,\\nand the azalea. A taxi was waiting at the door.\\n\\nEdith opened the boxes, cutting the string with scissors. She put four\\ngowns out on the sofa. Grace explained that two were cloaks, two were\\ngowns--all she could get.\\n\\n'That's the one,' said Edith, taking out one of a deep blue colour,\\nlike an Italian sky on a coloured picture post-card. It had a collar of\\nthe same deep blue, spotted with white--a birdseye effect. Taking off\\nher coat Edith slipped the gown over her dress, and went to her room\\n(followed closely by Miss Bennett) to see herself in the long mirror.\\n\\n'Perfect!' said Edith. 'Only I must cut off those buttons. I hate\\nbuttons.'\\n\\n'How are you going to fasten it, then, dear?'\\n\\n'With hooks and eyes. Marie can sew them on.'\\n\\nThe deep blue with the white spots had a vivid and charming effect, and\\nsuited her blonde colouring; she saw she was very pretty in it, and was\\npleased.\\n\\n'Aren't you going to try the others on, dear?' asked Grace.\\n\\n'No; what's the good? This one will do.'\\n\\n'Right. Then I'll take them back.'\\n\\n'You're sweet. Won't you come back to lunch?'\\n\\n'I'll come back to lunch tomorrow,' said Miss Bennett, 'and you can\\ntell me about your tea-party. Oh, and here's a little bit of stuff for\\nthe plant. I suppose you'll put the azalea into the large pewter vase?'\\n\\n'Yes, and I'll tie this round its neck.'\\n\\n'Sorry it's cotton,' said Miss Bennett. 'I couldn't get any silk the\\nright colour.'\\n\\n'Oh, I like cotton, if only it's not called sateen! Good-bye, darling.\\nYou're delightfully quick!'\\n\\n'Yes, I don't waste time,' said Miss Bennett. 'Mother says, too, that\\nI'm the best shopper in the world.' She turned round to add, 'I'm dying\\nto know why you want to look so pretty. Who is it?'\\n\\nWith a quiet smile, Edith dismissed her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nP.P.C.\\n\\n'It always seems to me so unlike you,' Aylmer said (he had arrived\\npunctually at twenty minutes to four)--'your extreme fondness for\\nnewspapers. You're quite celebrated as a collector of Last Editions,\\naren't you?'\\n\\n'I know it's very unliterary of me, but I enjoy reading newspapers\\nbetter than reading anything else in the world. After all, it's\\ncontemporary history, that's my defence. But I suppose it is because\\nI'm so intensely interested in life.'\\n\\n'Tell me exactly, what papers do you really read?'\\n\\nShe laughed. 'Four morning papers--never mind their names--four\\nevening papers; five Sunday papers: _The Academy, The Saturday Review,\\nThe Bookman, The World, The English Review_.'\\n\\n'Well, I think it's wicked of you to encourage all this frivolity. And\\nwhat price _The Queen, Horrie Notes, or The Tatler_?'\\n\\n'Oh, we have those too--for Bruce.'\\n\\n'And does Archie show any of this morbid desire for journalism?'\\n\\n'Oh yes. He takes in _Chums and Little Folks_.'\\n\\n'And I see you're reading _Rhythm_. That's Vincy's fault, of course.'\\n\\n'Perhaps it is.'\\n\\n'How do you find time for all this culture?'\\n\\n'I read quickly, and what I have to do I do rather quickly.'\\n\\n'Is that why you never seem in a hurry? I think you're the only\\nleisured-looking woman I know in London.'\\n\\n'I do think I've solved the problem of labour-saving; I've reduced it\\nto a science.'\\n\\n'How?'\\n\\n'By not working, I suppose.'\\n\\n'You're wonderful. And that blue....'\\n\\n'Do you really think so?'\\n\\nHe was beginning to get carried away. He stood up and looked out of the\\nwindow. The pink and white hyacinths were strongly scented in the warm\\nair. He turned round.\\n\\nShe said demurely: 'It will be nice weather for you to go away now,\\nwon't it?'\\n\\n'I don't think so.' He spoke impulsively. 'I shall hate it; I shall be\\nmiserable.'\\n\\n'Really!' in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n'You're dying to ask me something,' he said.\\n\\n'Which am I dying to ask you: _where_ you're going, or _why_ you're\\ngoing?' She gave her most vivid smile. He sat down with a sigh. People\\nstill sigh, sometimes, even nowadays.\\n\\n'I don't know where I'm going; but I'll tell you why.... I'm seeing too\\nmuch of you.'\\n\\nShe was silent.\\n\\n'You see, Mrs Ottley, seeing a great deal of you is very entrancing,\\nbut it's dangerous.'\\n\\n'In what way?'\\n\\n'Well--your society--you see one gets to feel one can't do without it,\\ndo you see?'\\n\\n'But why should you do without it?'\\n\\nHe looked at her. 'You mean there's no reason why we shouldn't keep on\\ngoing to plays with Bruce, dining with Bruce, being always with Bruce?'\\n(Bruce and Aylmer had become so intimate that they called each other by\\ntheir Christian names.) 'Don't you see, it makes one sometimes feel one\\nwants more and more of you--of your society I mean. One could talk\\nbetter alone.'\\n\\n'But you can come and see me sometimes, can't you?'\\n\\n'Yes; that's the worst of all,' he answered, with emphasis.\\n\\n'Oh.'\\n\\nAylmer spoke decidedly: 'I'm not a man who could ever be a tame cat.\\nAnd also I'm not, I hope, a man who--who would dare to think, or even\\nwish, to spoil--to--'\\n\\n'And is that really why you're going?' she asked gently.\\n\\n'You're forcing me to answer you.'\\n\\n'And shall you soon forget all about it?'\\n\\nHe changed his position and sat next to her on the sofa.\\n\\n'And so you won't miss me a bit,' he said caressingly. 'You wouldn't\\ncare if you never saw me again, would you?'\\n\\n'Yes, I should care. Why, you know we're awfully good friends; I like\\nyou immensely.'\\n\\n'As much as Vincy?'\\n\\n'Oh! So differently.'\\n\\n'I'm glad of that, at any rate!'\\n\\nThere was an embarrassed pause.\\n\\n'So this is really the last time I'm to see you for ages, Mrs Ottley?'\\n\\n'But aren't we all going to the theatre tomorrow? With you, I mean?\\nBruce said so.'\\n\\n'Oh yes. I mean the last time alone. Yes, I've got a box for _The\\nMoonshine Girl_. Bruce said you'd come. Lady Everard and Vincy will be\\nthere.'\\n\\n'That will be fun--I love that sort of show. It takes one right away\\nfrom life instead of struggling to imitate it badly like most plays.'\\n\\n'It's always delightful to hear what you say. And anything I see with\\nyou I enjoy, and believe to be better than it is,' said Aylmer. 'You\\nknow you cast a glamour over anything. But the next day I'm going away\\nfor three months at least.'\\n\\n'A long time.'\\n\\n'Is it? Will it seem long to you?'\\n\\n'Why, of course. We shall--I shall miss you very much. I told you so.'\\n\\n'Really?' he insisted.\\n\\n'Really,' she smiled.\\n\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\\nEdith felt less mistress of the situation than she had expected. She\\nwas faced with a choice; she felt it; she knew it. She didn't want him\\nto go. Still, perhaps.... There was a vibration in the air. Suddenly a\\nsharp ring was heard.\\n\\nOverpowered by a sudden impulse, Aylmer seized her impetuously by the\\nshoulders, kissed her roughly and at random before she could stop him,\\nand said incoherently: 'Edith! Good-bye. I love you, Edith,' and then\\nstood up by the mantelpiece.\\n\\n'Mr Vincy,' announced the servant.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n'The Moonshine Girl'\\n\\nThe next evening Bruce and Edith were going to the Society Theatre with\\nAylmer. It was their last meeting before he was to go away, Edith half\\nexpected that he would put it off, but there was no change made in the\\nplans, and they met in the box as arranged.\\n\\nAylmer had expected during the whole day to hear that she had managed\\nto postpone the party. At one moment he was frightened and rather\\nhorrified when he thought of what he had done. At another he was\\ndelighted and enchanted about it, and told himself that it was\\nabsolutely justified. After all, he couldn't do more than go away if he\\nfound he was too fond of her. No hero of romance could be expected to\\ndo more than that, and he wasn't a hero of romance; he didn't pretend\\nto be. But he _was_ a good fellow--and though Bruce's absurdities\\nirritated him a great deal he had a feeling of delicacy towards him,\\nand a scrupulousness that is not to be found every day. At other\\nmoments Aylmer swore to himself, cursing his impulsiveness, fearing she\\nnow would really not ever think of him as he wished, but as a hustling\\nsort of brute. But no--he didn't care. He had come at last to close\\nquarters with her. He had kissed the pretty little mouth that he had so\\noften watched with longing. He admitted to himself that he had really\\nwished to pose a little in her eyes: to be the noble hero in the third\\nact who goes away from temptation. But who does not wish for the _beau\\nrole_ before one's idol?\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis meeting at the play tonight was the sort of anti-climax that is\\nalmost invariable in a London romance. How he looked forward to it! For\\nafter Vincy came in only a few banalities had been said. He was to see\\nher now for the last time--the first time since he had given himself\\naway to her. Probably it was only her usual kindness to others that\\nprevented her getting out of the evening plans, he thought. Or--did she\\nwant to see him once more?\\n\\nAt dinner before the play Edith was very bright, and particularly\\npretty. Bruce, too, was in good spirits.\\n\\n'It's rather sickening,' he remarked, 'Aylmer going away like this; we\\nshall miss him horribly, sha'n't we? And then, where's the sense,\\nEdith, in a chap leaving London where he's been the whole of the awful\\nwinter, just as it begins to be pleasant here? Pass the salt; don't\\nspill it--that's unlucky. Not that I believe in any superstitious rot.\\nI can see the charm of the quaint old ideas about black cats and so\\nforth, but I don't for one moment attach any importance to them, nor to\\nthe number thirteen, nor any of that sort of bosh. Indeed as a matter\\nof fact, I walked round a ladder only today rather than go under it.\\nBut that's simply because I don't go in for trying to be especially\\noriginal.'\\n\\n'No, dear. I think you're quite right.'\\n\\n'And oddly enough--as I was trying to tell you just now, only you\\ndidn't seem to be listening--a black cat ran across my path only this\\nafternoon.' He smiled, gratified at the recollection.\\n\\n'How do you mean, your path? I didn't know you had one--or that there\\nwere any paths about here.'\\n\\n'How literal women are! I mean _I_ nearly ran over it in a taxi. When I\\nsay I nearly ran over it, I mean that a black cat on the same side of\\nthe taxi (if you must have details) ran away as the taxi drove on....\\nYes, Aylmer is a thoroughly good chap, and he and I have enormous\\nsympathy. I don't know any man in the world with whom I have more\\nintellectual sympathy than Aylmer Ross. Do you remember how I pointed\\nhim out to you at once at the Mitchells'? And sometimes when I think\\nhow you used to sneer at the Mitchells--oh, you did, you know, dear,\\nbefore you knew them--and I remember all the trouble I had to get you\\nto go there, I wonder--I simply wonder! Don't you see, through going\\nthere, as I advised, we've made one of the nicest friends we ever had.'\\n\\n'Really, Bruce, you didn't have _any_ trouble to get me to go to the\\nMitchells; you're forgetting. The trouble was I couldn't go there very\\nwell until I was asked. The very first time we were asked (if you\\nrecollect), we flew!'\\n\\n'Flew? Why, we went on the wrong night. That doesn't look as if I was\\nvery keen about it! However, I'm not blaming you, dear. It wasn't your\\nfault. Mind you,' continued Bruce, 'I consider the Society Theatre pure\\nfrivolity. But one thing I'll say, a bad show there is better than a\\ngood show anywhere else. There's always jolly music, pretty dresses,\\npretty girls--you don't mind my saying so, dear, do you?'\\n\\n'No, indeed. I think so myself.'\\n\\n'Of course, the first row of the chorus is not what it was when I was a\\nbachelor,' continued Bruce, frowning thoughtfully. 'Either they're not\\nso good-looking, or I don't admire them so much, or they don't admire\\n_me_ as much, or they're a different class, or--or--something!' he\\nlaughed.\\n\\n'You're pleased to be facetious,' remarked Edith.\\n\\n'My dear girl, you know perfectly well I think there's no-one else in\\nthe world like you. Wherever I go I always say there's no-one to touch\\nmy wife. No-one!'\\n\\nEdith got up. 'Very sweet of you.'\\n\\n'But,' continued Bruce, 'because I think you pretty, it doesn't follow\\nthat I think everybody else is hideous. I tell you that straight from\\nthe shoulder, and I must say this for you, dear, I've never seen any\\nsign of jealousy on your part.'\\n\\n'I'd show it soon enough if I felt it--if I thought I'd any cause,'\\nsaid Edith; 'but I didn't think I had.'\\n\\nBruce gave a rather fatuous smile. 'Oh, go and get ready, my dear,' he\\nanswered. 'Don't let's talk nonsense. Who's going to be there tonight,\\ndo you know?'\\n\\n'Oh, only Lady Everard and Vincy.'\\n\\n'Lady Everard is a nice woman. You're going to that musical thing of\\nhers, I suppose?'\\n\\n'Yes, I suppose so.'\\n\\n'It's in the afternoon, and it's not very easy for me to get away in\\nthe afternoon, but to please you, I'll take you--see? I loathe music\\n(except musical comedies), and I think if ever there was a set of\\nappalling rotters--I feel inclined to knock them off the music-stool\\nthe way they go on at Lady Everard's--at the same time, some of them\\nare very cultured and intelligent chaps, and _she's_ a very charming\\nwoman. One can't get in a word edgeways, but _when_ one does--well, she\\nlistens, and laughs at one's jokes, and that sort of thing. I think I'm\\nrather glad you're not musical, Edith, it takes a woman away from her\\nhusband.'\\n\\n'Not musical! Oh dear! I thought I was,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Oh, anyhow, not when I'm here, so it doesn't matter. Besides, your\\nbeing appreciative and that sort of thing is very nice. Look what a\\nsocial success you've had at the Everards', for instance, through\\nlistening and understanding these things; it is not an accomplishment\\nto throw away. No, Edith dear, I should tell you, if you would only\\nlisten to me, to keep up your music, but you won't and there's an end\\nof it...That souffle was really very good. Cook's improving. For a\\nplain little cook like that, with such small wages, and no kitchenmaid,\\nshe does quite well.'\\n\\n'Oh yes, she's not bad,' said Edith. She knew that if Bruce had been\\naware the cook's remuneration was adequate he would not have enjoyed\\nhis dinner.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThey were in the box in the pretty theatre. Lady Everard, very smart in\\nblack, sparkling with diamonds, was already there with Aylmer. Vincy\\nhad not arrived.\\n\\nThe house was crammed to the ceiling. Gay, electrical music of\\nexhilarating futility was being played by the orchestra. The scene\\nconsisted of model cottages; a chorus of pretty girls in striped cotton\\nwere singing. The heroine came on; she was well known for her smile,\\nwhich had become public property on picture post-cards and the Obosh\\nbottles. She was dressed as a work-girl also, but in striped silk with\\na real lace apron and a few diamonds. Then the hero arrived. He wore a\\nred shirt, brown boots, and had a tenor voice. He explained an\\ninteresting little bit of the plot, which included an eccentric will\\nand other novelties. The humorous dandy of the play was greeted with\\nshouts of joy by the chorus and equal enthusiasm by the audience. He\\nagreed to change places with the hero, who wished to give up one\\nhundred and forty thousand pounds a year to marry the heroine.\\n\\n'Very disinterested,' murmured Lady Everard. 'Very nice of him, I'm\\nsure. It isn't many people that would do a thing like that. A nice\\nvoice, too. Of course, this is not what _I_ call good music, but it's\\nvery bright in its way, and the words--I always think these words are\\nso clever. So witty. Listen to them--do listen to them, dear Mrs\\nOttley.'\\n\\nThey listened to the beautiful words sung, of which the refrain ran as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n  'The Author told the Actor,\\n  (The Actor had a fit).\\n  The Box Office man told the Programme-girl,\\n  The Theatre all was in quite a whirl.\\n  The call-boy told the Chorus.\\n  (Whatever could it be?)\\n  The super asked the Manager,\\n  What did the Censor see?'\\n\\n'Charming,' murmured Lady Everard; 'brilliant--I know his father so\\nwell.'\\n\\n'Whose father--the censor's?'\\n\\n'Oh, the father of the composer--a very charming man. When he was young\\nhe used to come to my parties--my Wednesdays. I used to have Wednesdays\\nthen. I don't have Wednesdays now. I think it better to telephone at\\nthe last minute any particular day for my afternoons because, after\\nall, you never know when the artists one wants are disengaged, does\\none? You're coming on Wednesday to hear Paul La France sing, dear Mrs\\nOttley?'\\n\\nEdith smiled and nodded assent, trying to stop the incessant trickle of\\nLady Everard's leaking conversation. She loved theatres, and she\\nenjoyed hearing every word, which was impossible while there was more\\ndialogue in the box than on the stage; also, Aylmer was sitting behind\\nher.\\n\\nThe comic lady now came on; there were shrieks of laughter at her\\nunnecessary and irrelevant green boots and crinoline and Cockney\\naccent. She proposed to marry the hero, who ran away from her. There\\nwas more chorus; and the curtain fell.\\n\\nIn the interval Vincy arrived. He and Bruce went into the little salon\\nbehind the box. Lady Everard joined them there. Edith and Aylmer looked\\nround the house. The audience at the Society Theatre is a special one;\\nas at the plays in which the favourite actor-managers and _jeunes\\npremiers_ perform there are always far more women than men, at this\\ntheatre there are always far more men than women.\\n\\nThe stage box opposite our friends was filled with a party of about ten\\nmen.\\n\\n'It looks like a jury,' said Edith. 'Perhaps it is.' 'Probably a board\\nof directors,' said Aylmer.\\n\\nThe first two rows of the stalls were principally occupied by\\nmiddle-aged and rather elderly gentlemen. Many had grey moustaches and\\na military bearing. Others were inclined to be stout, with brilliant\\nexuberant manners and very dark hair that simply wouldn't lie flat.\\nThere were a great many parties made up like those of our friends--of\\nsomebody in love with somebody, surrounded by chaperons. These were the\\nsocial people, and also there were a certain number of young men with\\npretty women who were too fashionably dressed, too much made up, and\\nwho were looking forward too much to supper. These ladies seemed\\ninclined to crab the play, and to find unimportant little faults with\\nthe unimportant actresses. There were many Americans--who took it\\nseriously; and altogether one could see it was an immense success; in\\nother words everyone had paid for their seats...\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe play was over; Aylmer had not had a word with Edith. He was going\\naway the next day, and he asked them all to supper. Of course he drove\\nEdith, and Lady Everard took the other two in her motor....\\n\\n'You're an angel if you've forgiven me,' he said, as they went out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nThe Supper-party\\n\\n'Have you forgiven me?' he asked anxiously, as soon as they were in the\\ndark shelter of the cab.\\n\\n'Yes, oh yes. Please don't let's talk about it any more... What time do\\nyou start tomorrow?'\\n\\n'You think I ought to go then?'\\n\\n'You say so.'\\n\\n'But you'd rather I remained here; rather we should go on as we\\nare--wouldn't you?'\\n\\n'Well, you know I should never have dreamt of suggesting you should go\\naway. I like you to be here.'\\n\\n'At any cost to me? No, Edith; I can't stand it. And since I've told\\nyou it's harder. Your knowing makes it harder.'\\n\\n'I should have thought that if you liked anyone so _very_ much, you\\nwould want to see them all the time, as much as possible, always--even\\nwith other people...anything rather than not see them--be away\\naltogether. At least, that's how I should feel.'\\n\\n'No doubt you would; that's a woman's view. And besides, you see, you\\ndon't care!'\\n\\n'The more I cared, the less I should go away, I think.'\\n\\n'But, haven't I tried? And I can't bear it. You don't know how cruel\\nyou are with your sweetness, Edith...Oh, put yourself in my place! How\\ndo you suppose I feel when I've been with you like this, near you,\\nlooking at you, delighting in you the whole evening--and then, after\\nsupper, you go away with Bruce? _You've_ had a very pleasant evening,\\nno doubt; it's all right for you to feel you've got me, as you know you\\nhave--and with no fear, no danger. Yes, you enjoy it!'\\n\\n'Oh, Aylmer!'\\n\\nHe saw in the half-darkness that her eyes looked reproachful.\\n\\n'I didn't mean it. I'm sorry--I'm always being sorry.' His bitter tone\\nchanged to gentleness. 'I want to speak to you now, Edith. We haven't\\nmuch time. Don't take away your hand a minute....I always told you,\\ndidn't I, that the atmosphere round you is so clear that I feel with\\nyou I'm in the Palace of Truth? You're so _real_. You're the only woman\\nI ever met who really cared for truth. You're not afraid of it; and\\nyou're as straight and honourable as a man! I don't mean you can't\\ndiplomatise if you choose, of course, and better than anyone; but it\\nisn't your nature to deceive yourself, nor anyone else. I recognise\\nthat in you. I love it. And that's why I can't pretend or act with you;\\nI must be frank.'\\n\\n'Please, do be frank.'\\n\\n'I love you. I'm madly in love with you. I adore you.'\\n\\nAylmer stopped, deeply moved at the sound of his own words. Few people\\nrealise the effect such words have on the speaker. Saying them to her\\nwas a great joy, and an indulgence, but it increased painfully his\\npassionate feeling, making it more accentuated and acute. To let\\nhimself go verbally was a wild, bitter pleasure. It hurt him, and he\\nenjoyed it.\\n\\n'And I'd do anything in the world to get you. And I'd do anything in\\nthe world for you, too. And if you cared for me I'd go away all the\\nsame. At least, I believe I should...We shall be there in a minute.\\n\\n'Listen, dear. I want you, occasionally, to write to me; there's no\\nearthly reason why you shouldn't. I'll let you know my address. It will\\nprevent my being too miserable, or rushing back. And will you do\\nsomething else for me?'\\n\\n'Anything.'\\n\\n'Angel! Well, when you write, call me Aylmer. You never have yet, in a\\nletter. Treat me just like a friend--as you treat Vincy. Tell me what\\nyou're doing, where you're going, who you see; about Archie and Dilly;\\nabout your new dresses and hats; what you're reading--any little thing,\\nso that I'm still in touch with you.'\\n\\n'Yes, I will; I shall like to. And don't be depressed, Aylmer. Do enjoy\\nyour journey; write to me, too.'\\n\\n'Yes, I'm going to write to you, but only in an official way, only for\\nBruce. And, listen. Take care of yourself. You're too unselfish. Do\\nwhat you want sometimes, not what other people want all the time. Don't\\nread too much by electric light and try your eyes. And don't go out in\\nthese thin shoes in damp weather--promise!'\\n\\nShe laughed a little--touched.\\n\\n'Be a great deal with the children. I like to think of you with them.\\nAnd I hope you won't be always going out,' he continued, in a tone of\\nunconscious command, which she enjoyed....'Please don't be continually\\nat Lady Everard's, or at the Mitchells', or anywhere. I hate you to be\\nadmired--how I hate it!'\\n\\n'Fancy! And I was always brought up to believe people are proud of\\nwhat's called the 'success' of the people that they--like.'\\n\\n'Don't you believe it, Edith! That's all bosh--vanity and nonsense. At\\nany rate, I know I'm not. In fact, as I can't have you myself, I would\\nreally like you to be shut up. Very happy, very well, with everything\\nin the world you like, even thinking of me a little, but absolutely\\nshut up! And if you did go out, for a breath of air, I should like\\nno-one to see you. I'd like you to cover up your head--wear a thick\\nveil--and a thick loose dress!'\\n\\n'You're very Oriental!' she laughed.\\n\\n'I'm not a bit Oriental; I'm human. It's selfish, I suppose, you think?\\nWell, let me tell you, if you care to know, that it's _love_, and\\nnothing else, Edith....Now, is there anything in the world I can do for\\nyou while I'm away? It would be kind to ask me. Remember I shan't see\\nyou for three months. I may come back in September. Can't I send you\\nsomething--do something that you'd like? I count on you to ask me at\\nany time if there's anything in the world I could do for you, no matter\\nwhat!'\\n\\nNo woman could help being really pleased at such whole-hearted\\ndevotion and such Bluebeard-like views--especially when they were not\\ngoing to be carried out. Edith was thrilled by the passionate emotion\\nshe felt near her. How cold it would be when he had gone! He _was_\\nnice, handsome, clever--a darling!\\n\\n'Don't forget me, Aylmer. I don't want you to forget me. Later on we'll\\nhave a real friendship.'\\n\\n'_Friendship!_ Don't use that word. It's so false--such humbug--for\\n_me_ at any rate. To say I could care for you as a friend is simply\\nblasphemy! How can it be possible for _me_? But I'll try. Thanks for\\n_any_thing! You're an angel--I'll try.'\\n\\n'And it's horribly inconsistent, and no doubt very wicked of me, but,\\ndo you know, I should be rather pained if I heard you had fallen in\\nlove with someone else.'\\n\\n'Ah, that would be impossible!' he cried. 'Never--never! It's the real\\nthing; there never was anyone like you, there never will be.\\n\\nLet me look at you once more....Oh, Edith! And now--here we are.'\\n\\nEdith took away her hand. 'Your scarf's coming off, you'll catch\\ncold,' said Aylmer, and as he was trying, rather awkwardly, to put the\\npiece of blue chiffon round her head he drew the dear head to him and\\nkissed her harshly. She could not protest; it was too final; besides,\\nthey were arriving; the cab stopped. Vincy came to the door.\\n\\n'Welcome to Normanhurst!' cried Vincy, with unnecessary facetiousness,\\ngiving them a slightly anxious glance. He thought Edith had more colour\\nthan usual. Aylmer was pale.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe supper was an absolute and complete failure; the guests\\ndisplayed the forced gaiety and real depression, and constrained\\nabsentmindedness, of genuine and hopeless boredom. Except for Lady\\nEverard's ceaseless flow of empty prattle the pauses would have been\\ntoo obvious. Edith, for whom it was a dreary anti-climax, was rather\\nsilent. Aylmer talked more, and a little more loudly, than usual, and\\nlooked worn. Bruce, whom champagne quickly saddened, became vaguely\\nreminiscent and communicative about old, dead, forgotten grievances of\\nthe past, while Vincy, who was a little shocked at what he saw (and he\\nalways saw everything), did his very best, just saving the\\nentertainment from being a too disastrous frost.\\n\\n'Well! Good luck!' said Aylmer, lifting his glass with sham\\nconviviality.' I start tomorrow morning by the Orient Express.'\\n\\n'Hooray!' whispered Vincy primly.\\n\\n'Doesn't it sound romantic and exciting?' Edith said. 'The two words\\ntogether are so delightfully adventurous. Orient--the languid East,\\nand yet express--quickness, speed. It's a fascinating blend of ideas.'\\n\\n'Whether it's adventurous or not isn't the question, my dear girl; I\\nonly wish we were going too,' said Bruce, with a sigh; 'but, I never\\ncan get away from my wretched work, to have any fun, like you lucky\\nchaps, with no responsibilities or troubles! I suppose perhaps we may\\ntake the children to Westgate for Whitsuntide, and that's about all.\\nNot that there isn't quite a good hotel there, and of course it's all\\nright for me, because I shall play golf all day and run up to town when\\nI want to. Still, it's very different from one of these jolly long\\njourneys that you gay bachelors can indulge in.'\\n\\n'But I'm not a gay bachelor. My boy is coming to join me in the summer\\nholidays, wherever I am,' said Aylmer.\\n\\n'Ah, but that's not the point. I should like to go with you now--at\\nonce. Don't you wish we were both going, Edith? Why aren't we going\\nwith him tomorrow?'\\n\\n'Surely June's just the nice time in London, Bruce,' said Vincy, in his\\ndemure voice.\\n\\n'Won't it be terribly hot?' said Lady Everard vaguely. She always\\nthought every place must be terribly hot. 'Venice? Are you going to\\nVenice? Delightful! The Viennese are so charming, and the Austrian\\nofficers--Oh, you're going to Sicily first? Far too hot. Paul La\\nFrance--the young singer, you know--told me that when he was in Sicily\\nhis voice completely altered; the heat quite affected the _veloute_ of\\nhis voice, as the French call it--and what a voice it is at its best!\\nIt's not the _highest_ tenor, of course, but the medium is so\\nwonderfully soft and well developed. I don't say for a moment that he\\nwill ever be a Caruso, but as far as he goes--and he goes pretty far,\\nmind--it's really wonderful. You're coming on Wednesday, aren't you,\\ndear Mrs Ottley? Ah!'... She stopped and held up her small beaded fan,\\n'what's that the band's playing? I know it so well; everyone knows it;\\nit's either _Pagliacci_ or _Boheme_, or _some_thing. No, isn't it\\nreally? What is it? All the old Italian operas are coming in again, by\\nthe way, you know, my dear... _Rigoletto_, _Lucia_, _Traviata_--the\\n_bel canto_--that sort of thing; there's nothing like it for showing\\noff the voice. Wagner's practically gone out (at least what _I_ call\\nout), and I always said Debussy wouldn't last. Paul La France still\\nclings to Brahms--Brahms suits his voice better than anyone else. He\\nalways falls back on Brahms, and dear de Lara; and Tosti; of course,\\nTosti. I remember...'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAylmer and his guests had reached the stage of being apparently all\\nlost in their own thoughts, and the conversation had been practically\\nreduced to a disjointed monologue on music by Lady Everard, when the\\nlights began to be lowered, and the party broke up.\\n\\n'I'm coming to see you so soon,' said Vincy.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nThe Letter\\n\\nIt was about a fortnight later.\\n\\nEdith and Bruce, from different directions, arrived at the same moment\\nat their door, and went up together in the lift. On the little\\nhall-table was a letter addressed to Edith. She took it up rather\\nquickly, and went into the drawing-room. Bruce followed her.\\n\\n'That a letter, Edith?'\\n\\n'What do you suppose it is, Bruce?'\\n\\n'What _could_ I have supposed it was, Edith? A plum pudding?' He\\nlaughed very much.\\n\\n'You are very humorous today, Bruce.'\\n\\nShe sat down with her hat, veil and gloves on, holding the letter. She\\ndid not go to her room, because that would leave her no further\\nretreat. Bruce sat down exactly opposite to her, with his coat and\\ngloves on. He slowly drew off one glove, folded it carefully, and put\\nit down. Then he said amiably, a little huskily:\\n\\n'Letter from a friend?'\\n\\n'I beg your pardon? What did you say, dear?'\\n\\nHe raised his voice unnecessarily:\\n\\n'I Said A LETTER FROM A FRIEND!'\\n\\nShe started. 'Oh yes! I heard this time.'\\n\\n'Edith, I know of an excellent aurist in Bond Street. I wish you'd go\\nand see him. I'll give you the address.'\\n\\n'I know of a very good elocutionist in Oxford Street. I think I would\\ngo and have some lessons, if I were you, Bruce; the summer classes are\\njust beginning. They teach you to speak so clearly, to get your voice\\nover the footlights, as it were. I think all men require to study\\noratory and elocution. It comes in so useful!'\\n\\nBruce lowered his voice almost to a whisper.\\n\\n'Are you playing the fool with me?'\\n\\nShe nodded amiably in the manner of a person perfectly deaf, but who is\\npretending to hear.\\n\\n'Yes, dear; yes, quite right.'\\n\\n'What do you mean by 'quite right'?' He unfastened his coat and threw\\nit open, glaring at her a little.\\n\\n'Who--me? _I_ don't know.'\\n\\n'Who is that letter from, Edith?' he said breezily, in a tone of sudden\\ncareless and cheery interest.\\n\\n'I haven't read it yet, Bruce,' she answered, in the same tone,\\nbrightly.\\n\\n'Oh. Why don't you read it?'\\n\\n'Oh! I shall presently.'\\n\\n'When?'\\n\\n'When I've opened it.'\\n\\nHe took off his other glove, folded it with the first one, made them\\ninto a ball, and threw it across the room against the window, while his\\ncolour deepened.\\n\\n'Oh, do you want to have a game? Shall I send for Archie?'\\n\\n'Edith, why don't you take off your hat?'\\n\\n'I can't think. Why don't you take off your coat?'\\n\\n'I haven't time. Show me that letter.'\\n\\n'What letter?'\\n\\n'Don't prevaricate with me.' Bruce had now definitely lost his temper.\\n'I can stand anything except prevarication. Anything in the world, but\\nprevarication, I can endure, with patience. But _not_ that! As if you\\ndidn't know perfectly well there's only one letter I want to see.'\\n\\n'Really?'\\n\\n'Who's your letter from?'\\n\\n'How should I know?'\\n\\nEdith got up and went towards the door. Bruce was beforehand with her\\nand barred the way, standing with his arms outstretched and his back to\\nthe door.\\n\\n'Edith, I'm pained and surprised at your conduct!'\\n\\n'Conduct!' she exclaimed.\\n\\n'Don't echo my words! I will _not_ be echoed, do you hear?...\\nBehaviour, then, if you prefer the word.... Why don't you wish me to\\nsee that letter?'\\n\\nEdith quickly looked at the letter. Until this moment she had had an\\nunreasonable and nervous terror that Aylmer might have forgotten his\\nintention of writing what he called officially, and might have written\\nher what she now inwardly termed a lot of nonsense. But she now saw she\\nhad made a mistake: it was not his handwriting nor his postmark. She\\nbecame firmer.\\n\\n'Look here Bruce,' she said, in a decided voice, quietly. 'We have been\\nmarried eight years, and I consider you ought to trust me sufficiently\\nto allow me to open my own letters.'\\n\\n'Oh, you do, do you? What next? What next! I suppose the next thing\\nyou'll wish is to be a suffragette.'\\n\\n'The question,' said Edith, in the most cool, high, irritating voice\\nshe could command, 'really, of votes for women hardly enters into our\\nargument here. As a matter of fact, I take no interest in any kind of\\npolitics, and, I may be entirely wrong, but if I were compelled to take\\nsides on the subject, I should be an anti-suffragist.'\\n\\n'Oh, you would, would you? That's as well to know! That's interesting.\\nGive me that letter.'\\n\\n'Do you think you have the right to speak to me like that?'\\n\\n'Edith,' he said rather pathetically, trying to control himself. 'I beg\\nyou, I _implore_ you to let me see the letter! Hang it all! You know\\nperfectly well, old girl, how fond I am of you. I may worry you a bit\\nsometimes, but you know my heart's all right.'\\n\\n'Of course, Bruce; I'm not finding fault with you. I only want to read\\nmy own letter, that's all.'\\n\\n'But if I let you out of this room without having shown it me, then if\\nthere's something you don't want me to see, you'll tear it up or chuck\\nit in the fire.'\\n\\nEdith was quite impressed at this flash of prophetic insight. She\\nadmitted to herself he was right.\\n\\n'It's entirely a matter of principle,' she said after another\\nreassuring look at the envelope. 'It's only a matter of principle,\\ndear, I'm twenty-eight years old, we've been married eight years; you\\nleave the housekeeping, the whole ordering of the children's education,\\nand heaps of other quite important things, entirely to me; in fact, you\\nlead almost the life of a schoolboy, without any of the tiresome part,\\nand with freedom, going to school in the day and amusing yourself in\\nthe evening, while everything disagreeable and important is thought of\\nand seen to for you. You only have the children with you when they\\namuse you. I have all the responsibility; I have to be patient,\\nthoughtful--in fact, you leave things to me more than most men do to\\ntheir wives, Bruce. You won't be bothered even to look at an\\naccount--to do a thing. But I'm not complaining.'\\n\\n'Oh, you're not! It sounded a little like it.'\\n\\n'But it isn't. I don't _mind_ all this responsibility, but I ought, at\\nleast, to be allowed to read my letters.'\\n\\n'Well, darling, you shall, as a rule. Look here, old girl, you shall. I\\npromise you, faithfully, dear. Oh, Edith, you're looking awfully\\npretty; I like that hat. Look here, I promise you, dear, I'll _never_\\nask you again, never as long as I live. But I've a fancy to read this\\nparticular letter. Why not just gratify it? It's a very harmless whim.'\\nHis tone suddenly changed. 'What do you suppose there's _in_ the damned\\nletter? Something you're jolly well anxious I shouldn't see.'\\n\\nShe made a step forward. He rushed at her, snatched the letter out of\\nher hand, and went to the window with it.\\n\\nShe went into her own room, shut the door, and threw herself on the\\nbed, her whole frame shaking with suppressed laughter.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBruce, alone, with trembling fingers tore open the envelope. Never in\\nhis life had he been opposed by Edith before in this way. He read these\\nwords in stereotyped writing:\\n\\n_'Van will call on receipt of post-card. The Lavender Laundry hopes\\nthat you will give them a trial, as their terms are extremely mod--'_\\n\\nBruce rushed to the door and called out:\\n\\n'Edith! Sorry! Edie, I say, I'm sorry. Come back.'\\n\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\nHe pushed the letter under the door of her room, and said through the\\nkeyhole:\\n\\n'Edith, look here, I'm just going for a little walk. I'll be back to\\ndinner. Don't be angry.'\\n\\nBruce brought her home a large bunch of Parma violets. But neither of\\nthem ever referred to the question again, and for some time there was a\\nlittle less of the refrain of 'Am I master in my own house, or am I\\nnot?'\\n\\nThe next morning, when a long letter came from Aylmer, from Spain,\\nEdith read it at breakfast and Bruce didn't ask a single question.\\nHowever, she left it on his plate, as if by mistake. He might just as\\nwell read it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nMavis Argles\\n\\nVincy had the reputation of spending his fortune with elaborate yet\\ncareful lavishness, buying nothing that he did not enjoy, and giving\\naway everything he did not want. At the same time his friends\\noccasionally wondered on what he _did_ spend both his time and his\\nmoney. He was immensely popular, quite sought after socially; but he\\ndeclined half his invitations and lived a rather quiet existence in the\\nsmall flat, with its Oriental decorations and violent post-impressions\\nand fierce Chinese weapons, high up in Victoria Street. Vincy really\\nconcealed under an amiable and gentle exterior the kindest heart of any\\nman in London. There was 'more in him than met the eye,' as people say,\\nand, frank and confidential as he was to his really intimate friends,\\nat least one side of his life was lived in shadow. It was his secret\\nromance with a certain young girl artist, whom he saw rarely, for\\nsufficient reasons. He was not devoted to her in the way that he was to\\nEdith, for whom he had the wholehearted enthusiasm of a loyal friend,\\nand the idolising worship of a fanatic admirer. It was perhaps Vincy's\\nnature, a little, to sacrifice himself for anyone he was fond of. He\\nspent a great deal of time thinking out means of helping materially the\\nyoung art-student, and always he succeeded in this object by his\\nelaborate and tactful care. For he knew she was very, very poor, and\\nthat her pride was of an old-fashioned order--she never said she was\\nhard up, as every modern person does, whether rich or poor, but he knew\\nthat she really lacked what he considered very nearly--if not\\nquite--the necessities of life.\\n\\nVincy's feeling for her was a curious one. He had known her since she\\nwas sixteen (she was now twenty-four). Yet he did not trust her, and\\nshe troubled him. He had met her at a studio at a time when he had\\nthought of studying art seriously. Sometimes, something about her\\nworried and wearied him, yet he couldn't do without her for long. The\\nfact that he knew he was of great help to her fascinated him; he often\\nthought that if she had been rich and he poor he would never wish to\\nsee her again. Certainly it was the touch of pathos in her life that\\nheld him; also, of course, she was pretty, with a pale thin face, deep\\nblue eyes, and rich dark red frizzy hair that was always coming\\ndown--the untidy hair of the art-student.\\n\\nHe was very much afraid of compromising her, and _she_ was very much\\nafraid of the elderly aunt with whom she lived. She had no parents,\\nwhich made her more pathetic, but no more free. He could not go and see\\nher, with any satisfaction to either of them, at _her_ home, though he\\ndid so occasionally. This was why she first went to see him at his\\nflat. But these visits, as they were both placed, could, of course,\\nhappen rarely.\\n\\nMavis Argles--this was the girl's extraordinary name--had a curious\\nfascination for him. He was rather fond of her, yet the greatest wish\\nhe had in the world was to break it off. When with her he felt himself\\nto be at once a criminal and a benefactor, a sinner and a saint.\\nTheoretically, theatrically, and perhaps conventionally, his relations\\nwith her constituted him the villain of the piece. Yet he behaved to\\nher more like Don Quixote than Don Juan....\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOne afternoon about four o'clock--he was expecting her--Vincy had\\narranged an elaborate tea on his little green marble dining-table.\\nEverything was there that she liked. She was particularly attached to\\nscones; he also had cream-cakes, sandwiches, sweets, chocolate and\\nstrawberries. As he heard the well-known slightly creaking step, his\\nheart began to beat loudly--quick beats. He changed colour, smiled, and\\nnervously went to the door.\\n\\n'Here you are, Mavis!' He calmed her and himself by this banal welcome.\\n\\nHe made a movement to help her off with her coat, but she stopped him,\\nand he didn't insist, guessing that she supposed her blouse to be unfit\\nfor publication.\\n\\nShe sat down on the sofa, and leaned back, looking at him with her\\npretty, weary, dreary, young, blue eyes.\\n\\n'It seems such a long time since I saw you,' said Vincy. 'You're tired;\\nI wish I had a lift.'\\n\\n'I am tired,' she spoke in rather a hoarse voice always. 'And I ought\\nnot to stop long.'\\n\\n'Oh, stay a minute longer, won't you?' he asked.\\n\\n'Well, I like that! I've only just this moment arrived!'\\n\\n'Oh, Mavis, don't say that! Have some tea.'\\n\\nHe waited on her till she looked brighter.\\n\\n'How is Aunt Jessie?'\\n\\n'Aunt Jessie's been rather ill.'\\n\\n'Still that nasty pain?' asked Vincy.\\n\\nShe stared at him, then laughed.\\n\\n'As if you remember anything about it.'\\n\\n'Oh, Mavis! I do remember it. I remember what was the matter with her\\nquite well.'\\n\\n'I bet you don't. What was it?' she asked, with childish eagerness.\\n\\n'It was that wind round the heart that she gets sometimes. She told me\\nabout it. Nothing seems to shift it, either.'\\n\\nMavis laughed--hoarse, childlike laughter that brought tears to her\\neyes.\\n\\n'It's a shame to make fun of Aunt Jessie; she's a very, very good\\nsort.'\\n\\n'Oh, good gracious, Mavis, if it comes to sorts, I'm sure she's quite\\nat the top of the tree. But don't let's bother about her now.'\\n\\n'What _do_ you want to bother about?'\\n\\n'Couldn't you come out and dine with me, Mavis? It would be a\\nchange'--he was going to say 'for you', but altered it--'for me.'\\n\\n'Oh no, Vincy; you can't take me out to dinner. I don't look up to the\\nmark.' She looked in a glass. 'My hat--it's a very good hat--it cost\\nmore than you'd think--but it shows signs of wear.'\\n\\n'Oh, that reminds me,' began Vincy. 'What _do_ you think happened the\\nother day? A cousin of mine who was up in London a little while bought\\na hat--it didn't suit her, and she insisted on giving it to me! She\\ndidn't know what to do to get rid of it! I'd given her something or\\nother, for her birthday, and _she_ declared she would give this to _me_\\nfor _my_ birthday, and so--I've got it on my hands.'\\n\\n'What a very queer thing! It doesn't sound true.'\\n\\n'No; does it? Do have some more tea, Mavis darling.'\\n\\n'No, thanks; I'll have another cake.'\\n\\n'May I smoke?'\\n\\nShe laughed. 'Asking _me_! You do what you like in your own house.'\\n\\n'It's yours,' he answered, 'when you're here. And when you're not, even\\nmore,' he added as an afterthought.\\n\\nHe struck a match; she laughed and said: 'I don't believe I understand\\nyou a bit.'\\n\\n'Oh--I went to the play last night,' said Vincy. 'Oh, Mavis, it was\\nsuch a wearing play.'\\n\\n'All about nothing, I suppose? They always are, now.'\\n\\n'Oh no. It was all about everything. The people were _so_ clever; it\\nwas something cruel how clever they were. One man _did_ lay down the\\nlaw! Oh, didn't he though! I don't hold with being bullied and lectured\\nfrom the stage, do you, Mavis? It seems so unfair when you can't answer\\nback.'\\n\\n'Was it Bernard Shaw?' she asked.\\n\\n'No; it wasn't; not this time; it was someone else. Oh, I do feel\\nsometimes when I'm sitting in my stall, so good and quiet, holding my\\nprogramme nicely and sitting up straight to the table, as it were, and\\nthen a fellow lets me have it, tells me where I'm wrong and all that; I\\n_should_ like to stand up and give a back answer, wouldn't you?'\\n\\n'No; I'd like to see _you_ do it! Er--what colour is that hat that your\\ncousin gave you?'\\n\\n'Oh, colour?' he said thoughtfully, smoking. 'Let me see--what colour\\nwas it? It doesn't seem to me that it was any particular colour. It was\\na very curious colour. Sort of mole-colour. Or was it cerise? Or\\nviolet?... You wouldn't like to see it, would you?'\\n\\n'Why, yes, I'd like to see it; I wouldn't try it on of course.'\\n\\nHe opened the box.\\n\\n'Why, what a jolly hat!' she exclaimed. 'You may not know it, but that\\nwould just suit me; it would go with my dress, too.'\\n\\n'Fancy.'\\n\\nShe took off her own hat, and touched up her hair with her fingers, and\\ntried on the other. Under it her eyes brightened in front of the glass;\\nher colour rose; she changed as one looked at her--she was sixteen\\nagain--the child he had first met at the Art School.\\n\\n'Don't you think it suits me?' she said, turning round.\\n\\n'Yes, I think you look very charming in it. Shall I put it back?'\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n'I sha'n't know what on earth to do with it,' he said discontentedly.\\n'It's so silly having a hat about in a place like this. Of course you\\nwouldn't dare to keep it, I suppose? It does suit you all right, you\\nknow; it would be awfully kind of you.'\\n\\n'What a funny person you are, Vincy. I _should_ like to keep it. What\\ncould I tell Aunt Jessie?'\\n\\n'Ah, well, you see, that's where it is! I suppose it wouldn't do for\\nyou to tell her the truth.'\\n\\n'What do you mean by the truth?'\\n\\n'I mean what I told you--how my cousin, Cissie Cavanack,' he smiled a\\nlittle as he invented this name, 'came up to town, chose the wrong hat,\\ndidn't know what to do with it--and, you know!'\\n\\n'I could tell her all that, of course.'\\n\\n'All right,' said Vincy, putting the other hat--the old one--in the\\nbox.' Where shall we dine?'\\n\\n'Oh, Vincy, I think you're very sweet to me, but how late dare I get\\nback to Ravenscourt Park?'\\n\\n'Why not miss the eight-five train?--then you'll catch the quarter to\\nten and get back at about eleven.'\\n\\n'Which would you _rather_ I did?'\\n\\n'Well, need you ask?'\\n\\n'I don't know, Vincy. I have a curious feeling sometimes. I believe\\nyou're rather glad when I've gone--relieved!'\\n\\n'Well, my dear,' he answered, 'look how you worry all the time! If\\nyou'd only have what I call a quiet set-down and a chat, without being\\nalways on the fidget, always looking either at the glass or at the\\nclock, one might _not_ have that feeling.'\\n\\nHer colour rose, and tears came to her eyes. 'Oh, then you _are_ glad\\nwhen I'm gone!' She pouted. 'You don't care for me a bit, Vincy,' she\\nsaid, in a plaintive voice.\\n\\nHe sat down next to her on the little striped sofa, and took her hand.\\n\\n'Oh, give over, Mavis, do give over! I wish you wouldn't carry on like\\nthat; you do carry on, Mavis dear, don't you? Some days you go on\\nsomething cruel, you do really. Reely, I mean. Now, cheer up and be\\njolly. Give a kiss to the pretty gentleman, and look at all these\\npretty good-conduct stripes on the sofa! There! That's better.'\\n\\n'Don't speak as if I were a baby!'\\n\\n'Do you mind telling me what we're quarrelling about, my dear? I only\\nask for information.'\\n\\n'Oh, we're _not_. You're awfully sweet. You know I love you, Vincy.'\\n\\n'I thought, perhaps, it was really all right.'\\n\\n'Sometimes I feel miserable and jealous.'\\n\\nHe smiled. 'Ah! What are you jealous of, Mavis?'\\n\\n'Oh, everything--everyone--all the people you meet.'\\n\\n'Is that all? Well, you're the only person I ever meet--by appointment,\\nat any rate.'\\n\\n'Well--the Ottleys!'\\n\\nHis eye instinctively travelled to a photograph of Edith, all tulle and\\nroses; a rather fascinating portrait.\\n\\n'What about _her_?' asked Mavis. 'What price Mrs Ottley?'\\n\\n'Really, Mavis!--What price? No price. Nothing about her; she's just a\\ngreat friend of mine. I think I told you that before. ... What a\\nfrightfully bright light there is in the room,' Vincy said. He got up\\nand drew the blind down. He came back to her.\\n\\n'Your hair's coming down,' he remarked.\\n\\n'I'm sorry,' she said. 'But at the back it generally is.'\\n\\n'Don't move--let me do it.'\\n\\nPretending to arrange it, he took all the hairpins out, and the cloud\\nof dark red hair fell down on her shoulders.\\n\\n'I like your hair, Mavis.'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n'It seems too awful I should have been with you such a long time this\\nafternoon,' she exclaimed.\\n\\n'It _isn't_ long.'\\n\\n'And sometimes it seems so dreadful to think I can't be with you\\nalways.'\\n\\n'Yes, doesn't it? Mavis dear, will you do up your hair and come out to\\ndinner?'\\n\\n'Vincy dear, I think I'd better not, because of Aunt Jessie.'\\n\\n'Oh, very well; all right. Then you will another time?'\\n\\n'Oh, you don't want me to stay?'\\n\\n'Yes, I do; do stay.'\\n\\n'No, next time--next Tuesday.'\\n\\n'Very well, very well.'\\n\\nHe took a dark red carnation out of one of the vases and pinned it on\\nto her coat.\\n\\n'The next time I see you,' she said, 'I want to have a long, _long_\\ntalk.'\\n\\n'Oh yes; we must, mustn't we?'\\n\\nHe took her downstairs, put her into a cab. It was half-past six.\\n\\nHe felt something false, worrying, unreliable and incalculable in\\nMavis. She didn't seem real.... He wished she were fortunate and happy;\\nbut he wished even more that he were never going to see her again. And\\nstill!...\\n\\nHe walked a little way, then got into a taxi and drove to see Edith.\\nWhen he was in this peculiar condition of mind--the odd mixture of\\nself-reproach, satisfaction, amusement and boredom that he felt now\\n--he always went to see Edith, throwing himself into the little affairs\\nof her life as if he had nothing else on his mind. He was a little\\nanxious about Edith. It seemed to him that since Aylmer had been away\\nshe had altered a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nMore of the Mitchells\\n\\nEdith had become an immense favourite with the Mitchells. They hardly\\never had any entertainment without her. Her success with their friends\\ndelighted Mrs Mitchell, who was not capable of commonplace feminine\\njealousy, and who regarded Edith as a find of her own. She often\\nreproached Winthrop, her husband, for having known Bruce eight years\\nwithout discovering his charming wife.\\n\\nOne evening they had a particularly gay party. Immediately after dinner\\nMitchell had insisted on dressing up, and was solemnly announced in his\\nown house as Prince Gonoff, a Russian noble. He had a mania for\\ndisguising himself. He had once travelled five hundred miles under the\\nname of Prince Gotoffski, in a fur coat, a foreign accent, a false\\nmoustache and a special saloon carriage. Indeed, only his wife knew all\\nthe secrets of Mitchell's wild early career of unpractical jokes, to\\nsome of which he still clung. When he was younger he had carried it\\npretty far. She encouraged him, yet at the same time she acted as\\nballast, and was always explaining his jokes; sometimes she was in\\ndanger of explaining him entirely away. She loved to tell of his\\nearlier exploits. How often, when younger, he had collected money for\\ncharities (particularly for the Deaf and Dumb Cats' League, in which he\\ntook special interest), by painting halves of salmon and ships on fire\\non the cold grey pavement! Armed with an accordion, and masked to the\\neyes, he had appeared at Eastbourne, and also at the Henley Regatta, as\\na Mysterious Musician. At the regatta he had been warned off the\\ncourse, to his great pride and joy. Mrs Mitchell assured Edith that his\\nbath-chair race with a few choice spirits was still talked of at St\\nLeonard's (bath-chairmen, of course, are put in the chairs, and you\\npull them along). Mr Mitchell was beaten by a short head, but that, Mrs\\nMitchell declared, was really most unfair, because he was so\\nhandicapped--his man was much stouter than any of the others--and the\\nrace, by rights, should have been run again.\\n\\nWhen he was at Oxford he had been well known for concealing under a\\nslightly rowdy exterior the highest spirits of any of the\\nundergraduates. He was looked upon as the most fascinating of\\n_farceurs_. It seems that he had distinguished himself there less for\\nwriting Greek verse, though he was good at it, than for the wonderful\\nvariety of fireworks that he persistently used to let off under the\\ndean's window. It was this fancy of his that led, first, to his\\npopularity, and afterwards to the unfortunate episode of his being sent\\ndown; soon after which he had married privately, chiefly in order to\\nsend his parents an announcement of his wedding in _The Morning Post_,\\nas a surprise.\\n\\nSome people had come in after dinner--for there was going to be a\\nlittle _sauterie intime_, as Mrs Mitchell called it, speaking in an\\naccent of her own, so appalling that, as Vincy observed, it made it\\nsound quite improper. Edith watched, intensely amused, as she saw that\\nthere were really one or two people present who, never having seen\\nMitchell before, naturally did not recognise him now, so that the\\ndisguise was considered a triumph. There was something truly agreeable\\nin the deference he was showing to a peculiarly yellow lady in red,\\nadorned with ugly real lace, and beautiful false hair. She was\\nobviously delighted with the Russian prince.\\n\\n'Winthrop is a wonderful man!' said Mrs Mitchell to Edith, as she\\nwatched her husband proudly. 'Who would dream he was clean-shaven! Look\\nat that moustache! Look at the wonderful way his coat doesn't fit; he's\\ngot just that Russian touch with his clothes; I don't know how he's\\ndone it, I'm sure. How I wish dear Aylmer Ross was here; he _would_\\nappreciate it so much.'\\n\\n'Yes, I wish he were,' said Edith.\\n\\n'I can't think what he went away for. I suppose he heard the East\\na-calling, and all that sort of thing. The old wandering craving you\\nread of came over him again, I suppose. Well, let's hope he'll meet\\nsome charming girl and bring her back as his bride. Where is he now, do\\nyou know, Mrs Ottley?'\\n\\n'In Armenia, I fancy,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Oh, well, we don't want him to bring home an Armenian, do we? What\\ncolour are they? Blue, or brown, or what? I hope no-one will tell Lady\\nHartland that is my husband. She'll expect to see Winthrop tonight; she\\nnever met him, you know; but he really ought to be introduced to her. I\\nthink I shall tell him to go and undress, when they've had a little\\ndancing and she's been down to supper.'\\n\\nLady Hartland was the yellow lady in red, who thought she was flirting\\nwith a fascinating Slav.\\n\\n'She's a sort of celebrity,' continued Mrs Mitchell. 'She was an\\nAmerican once, and she married Sir Charles Hartland for her money. I\\nhate these interested marriages, don't you?--especially when they're\\ninternational. Sir Charles isn't here; he's such a sweet boy. He's a\\nfriend of Mr Cricker; it's through Mr Cricker I know them, really. Lady\\nEverard has taken _such_ a fancy to young Cricker; she won't leave him\\nalone. After all he's _my_ friend, and as he's not musical I don't see\\nthat she has any special right to him; but he's there every Wednesday\\nnow, and does his dances on their Sunday evenings too. He's got a new\\none--lovely, quite lovely--an imitation of Lydia Kyasht as a\\nwater-nymph. I wanted him to do it here tonight, but Lady Everard has\\ntaken him to the opera. Now, won't you dance? Your husband promised he\\nwould. You both look so young!'\\n\\nEdith refused to dance. She sat in a corner with Vincy and watched the\\ndancers.\\n\\nBy special permission, as it was so _intime_, the Turkey Trot was\\nallowed. Bruce wanted to attempt it with Myra Mooney, but she was\\nhorrified, and insisted on dancing the 1880 _trois-temps_ to a jerky\\nAmerican two-step.\\n\\n'Edith,' said Vincy; 'I think you're quieter than you used to be.\\nSometimes you seem rather absent-minded.'\\n\\n'Am I? I'm sorry; there's nothing so tedious to other people. Why do\\nyou think I'm more serious?'\\n\\n'I think you miss Aylmer.'\\n\\n'Yes, I do. He gave a sort of meaning to everything. He's always\\ninteresting. And there's something about him--I don't know what it is.\\nOh, don't be frightened, Vincy, I'm not going to use the word\\npersonality. Isn't that one of the words that ought to be forbidden\\naltogether? In all novels and newspapers that poor, tired word is\\nalways cropping up.'\\n\\n'Yes, that and magnetism, and temperament, and technique. Let's cut out\\ntechnique altogether. Don't let there be any, that's the best way; then\\nno-one can say anything about it. I'm fed up with it. Aren't you?'\\n\\n'Oh, I don't agree with you at all. I think there ought to be any\\namount of technique, and personality, and magnetism, and temperament. I\\ndon't mind _how_ much technique there is, as long as nobody talks about\\nit. But neither of these expressions is quite so bad as that dreadful\\nthing you always find in American books, and that lots of people have\\ncaught up--especially palmists and manicures--mentality.'\\n\\n'Yes, mentality's very depressing,' said Vincy. 'I could get along\\nnicely without it, I think.... I had a long letter from Aylmer today.\\nHe seemed unhappy.'\\n\\n'I had a few lines yesterday,' said Edith. 'He said he was having a\\nvery good time. What did he say to you?'\\n\\n'Oh, he wrote, frankly to _me_.'\\n\\n'Bored, is he?'\\n\\n'Miserable; enamoured of sorrow; got the hump; frightfully off colour;\\nwants to come back to London. He misses the Mitchells. I suppose it's\\nthe Mitchells.'\\n\\nEdith smiled and looked pleased. 'He asked me not to come here much.'\\n\\n'Ah! But he wouldn't want you to go anywhere. That is so like Aylmer.\\nHe's not jealous; of course. How could he be? It's only a little\\nexclusiveness.... And how delightfully rare that is, Edith dear. I\\nadmire him for it. Most people now seem to treasure anything they value\\nin proportion to the extent that it's followed about and surrounded by\\nthe vulgar public. I sympathise with that feeling of wishing to\\nkeep--anything of that sort--to oneself.'\\n\\n'You are more secretive than jealous, yourself. But I have very much\\nthe same feeling,' Edith said. 'Many women I know think the ideal of\\nhappiness is to be in love with a great man, or to be the wife of a\\ngreat public success; to share his triumph! They forget you share the\\nman as well!'\\n\\n'I suppose the idea is that, after the publicity and the acclamation\\nand the fame and the public glory and the shouting, you take the person\\nhome, and feel he is only yours, really.'\\n\\n'But, can a famous person be only yours? No. I shouldn't like it.\\n\\nIt isn't that I don't _like_ cleverness and brilliance, but I don't\\ncare for the public glory.'\\n\\n'I see; you don't mind how great a genius he is, as long as he isn't\\nappreciated,' replied Vincy. 'Well, then, in heaven's name let us stick\\nto our obscurities!'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nThe Agonies of Aylmer\\n\\nIn the fresh cheerfulness of the early morning, after sleep, with the\\nhot June sun shining in at the window, Aylmer used to think he was\\nbetter. He would read his letters and papers, dress slowly, look out of\\nthe window at the crowds on the pavement--he had come back to\\nParis--feel the infectious cheeriness and sense of adventure of the\\ncity; then he would say to himself that his trip had been successful.\\nHe _was_ better. When he went out his heart began to sink a little\\nalready, but he fought it off; there would be a glimpse of an English\\nface flashing past in a carriage--he thought of Edith, but he put it\\naside. Then came lunch. For some reason, immediately after lunch his\\nmalady--for, of course, such love is a malady--incongruously attacked\\nhim in an acute form. 'Why after lunch?' he asked himself. Could it be\\nthat only when he was absolutely rested, before he had had any sort of\\nfatigue, that the deceptive improvement would show itself? He felt a\\nwondering humiliation at his own narrow grief.\\n\\nHowever, this was the hour that it recurred; he didn't know why. He had\\ntried all sorts of physical cures--for there is no disguising the fact\\nthat such suffering is physical, and so why should the cure not be,\\nalso? He had tried wine, no wine, exercise, distraction,\\neverything--and especially a constant change of scene. This last was\\nthe worst of all. He felt so exiled in Sicily, and in Spain--so\\nterribly far away--it was unbearable. He was happier directly he got\\nto Paris, because he seemed more in touch with England and her. Yes;\\nthe pain had begun again....\\n\\nAylmer went and sat alone outside the cafe. It was not his nature to\\ndwell on his own sensations. He would diagnose them quickly and\\nacutely, and then throw them aside. He was quickly bored with himself;\\nhe was no egotist. But today, he thought, he _would_ analyse his state,\\nto see what could be done.\\n\\nSix weeks! He had not seen her for six weeks. The longing was no\\nbetter. The pain seemed to begin at his throat, pressing down gradually\\non the chest It was that feeling of oppression, he supposed, that makes\\none sigh; as though there were a weight on the heart. And certain\\nlittle memories made it acute; sudden flashing vivid recollection of\\nthat last drive was like a sharp jagged tear. Had they ever been on\\nnearer terms, and had she treated him badly, it would not have caused\\nthis slow and insidious suffering. He was a man of spirit; he was proud\\nand energetic; he would have thrown it off. If he could have been angry\\nwith her, or despised her, he could have cured himself in time. Instead\\nof that, all the recollections were of an almost sickening sweetness;\\nparticularly that kiss on the day he went to see her. And the other,\\nthe _second_, was also the last; so it had a greater bitterness.\\n\\n  'Rapture sharper than a sword,\\n  Joy like o sudden spear.'\\n\\nThese words, casually read somewhere, came back to him whenever he\\nremembered her!\\n\\nAylmer had read, heard of these obsessions, but never believed in them.\\nIt was folly, madness!\\n\\nHe stood up, tossing his head as though to throw it off.\\n\\nHe went to fetch some friends, went with them to see pictures, to have\\ntea, and to drive in the Bois, accepting also an invitation to dine\\nwith a man--a nice boy--a fellow who had been at Oxford with him, and\\nwas at the embassy here, a young attache.\\n\\nHe was quite nice: a little dull, and a little too fond of talking\\nabout his chief.\\n\\nAylmer got home at about half-past six to dress for dinner. Then the\\ntorture began again. It was always worse towards evening--an agony of\\nlonging, regret, fury, vague jealousy and desire.\\n\\nHe stood and looked out of the window again at the crowd, hurrying\\nalong now to their pleasures or their happy homes. So many people in\\nthe world, like stars in the sky--why want the one star only? Why cry\\nfor the moon?\\n\\nHe had no photograph of her, but he still thought she was like his\\nmother's miniature, and often looked at it. He wished he wasn't going\\nto dine with that young man tonight. Aylmer was the most genial and\\nsociable of men; he usually disliked being alone; yet just now being\\nwith people bored him; it seemed an interruption. He was going through\\na crisis.\\n\\nYes; he could not stand anyone this evening. He rang the bell and sent\\na _petit bleu_ to say he was prevented from dining with his friend.\\nWhat a relief when he had sent this--now he could think of her alone\\nin peace....\\n\\nShe had never asked him to go away. It was his own idea. He had come\\naway to get over it. Well, he hadn't got over it. He was worse. But it\\nwasn't because he didn't see her; no, he didn't deceive himself. The\\nmore he saw of her the worse he would be. Not one man in a thousand was\\ncapable of feeling so intensely and deeply as Aylmer felt, and never in\\nhis life before had he felt anything like it. And now it came on again\\nwith the ebb and flow of passion, like an illness. Why was he so\\nmiserable--why would nothing else do? He suddenly remembered with a\\nsmile that when he was five years old he had adored a certain nurse,\\nand for some reason or other his mother sent her away. He had cried and\\ncried for her to come back. He remembered even now how people had said:\\n'Oh, the child will soon forget.' But he wore out their patience; he\\ncried himself to sleep every night. And his perseverance had at last\\nbeen rewarded. After six weeks the nurse came back. His mother sent for\\nher in despair at the boy's misery. How well he remembered that evening\\nand her plain brown face, with the twinkling eyes. How he kissed his\\nmother, and thanked her! The nurse stayed till he went to school and\\nthen he soon forgot all about her. Perhaps it was in his nature at rare\\nintervals to want one particular person so terribly, to pine and die\\nfor someone!\\n\\nThat was a recollection of babyhood, and yet he remembered even now\\nthat obstinate, aching longing.... He suddenly felt angry, furious.\\nWhat was Edith doing now? Saying good-night to Archie and Dilly? They\\ncertainly did look, as she had said, heavenly angels in their night\\nattire (he had been privileged to see them). Then she was dressing for\\ndinner and going out with Bruce. Good heavens! what noble action had\\nBruce ever done for _him_ that he should go away? Why make such a\\nsacrifice--for Bruce?\\n\\nPerhaps, sometimes, she really missed him a little. They had had great\\nfun together; she looked upon him as a friend; not only that, but he\\nknew that he amused her, that she liked him, thought him clever,\\nand--admired him even.\\n\\nBut that was all. Yet she _could_ have cared for him. He knew that. And\\nnot only in one way, but in every way. They could have been comrades\\ninterested in the same things; they had the same sense of humour, much\\nthe same point of view. She would have made him, probably,\\nself-restrained and patient as she was, in certain things. But, in\\nothers, wouldn't he have fired her with his own ideas and feelings, and\\nviolent passions and enthusiasms!\\n\\nShe was to be always with Bruce! That was to be her life!--Bruce, who\\nwas almost indescribable because he was neither bad, nor stupid, nor\\nbad-looking. He had only one fault. _'Il n'a qu'un defaut--il est\\nimpossible,'_ said Aylmer aloud to himself.\\n\\nHe took up a book--of course one of _her_ books, something she had lent\\nhim.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNow it was time to go out again--to dinner. He couldn't; it was too\\nmuch effort. Tonight he would give way, and suffer grief and desire and\\nlonging like a physical pain. He hadn't heard from her lately. Suppose\\nshe should be ill? Suppose she was forgetting him entirely? Soon they\\nwould be going away to some summer place with the children. He stamped\\nhis foot like an angry child as he imagined her in her thin summer\\nclothes. How people would admire her! How young she would look! Why\\ncouldn't he find some fault with her?--imagine her cold, priggish,\\ndull, too cautious. But he could only think of her as lovely, as beyond\\nexpression attractive, drawing him like a magnet, as marvellously kind,\\ngentle, graceful, and clever. He was obliged to use the stupid word\\nclever, as there was no other. He suddenly remembered her teeth when\\nshe smiled, and a certain slight wave in her thick hair that was a\\nnatural one. It is really barely decent to write about poor Aylmer as\\nhe is alone, suffering, thinking himself unwatched. He suddenly threw\\nhimself on his bed and gave way to a crisis of despair.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAbout an hour later, when the pain had somehow become stupefied, he lit\\na cigarette, ashamed of his emotion even to himself, and rang. The\\nservant brought him a letter--the English post.\\n\\nHe had thought so much of her, felt her so deeply the last few days\\nthat he fancied it must somehow have reached her. He read:\\n\\n'My Dear Aylmer,\\n\\n'I'm glad you are in Paris; it seems nearer home. Last night I went to\\nthe Mitchells' and Mr Mitchell disguised himself as a Russian Count.\\nNobody worried about it, and then he went and undisguised himself\\nagain. But Lady Hartland worried about it, and as she didn't know the\\nMitchells before, when he was introduced to her properly she begged him\\nto give her the address of that charming Russian. And Vincy was there,\\nand darling Vincy told me you'd written him a letter saying you weren't\\nso very happy. And oh, Aylmer, I don't see the point of your waiting\\ntill September to come back. Why don't you come _now_?\\n\\n'We're going away for Archie's holidays. Come back and see us and take\\nFreddie with us somewhere in England. You told me to ask you when I\\nwanted you--ask you anything I wanted. Well, I want to see you. I miss\\nyou too much. You arrived in Paris last night. Let me knew when you can\\ncome. I want you.\\n\\nEdith.'\\n\\nThe bell was rung violently. Orders were given, arrangements made,\\npacking was done. Aylmer was suddenly quite well, quite happy.\\n\\nIn a few hours he was in the midnight express due to arrive in London\\nat six in the morning--happy beyond expression.\\n\\nBy ten o'clock in the morning he would hear her voice on the telephone.\\n\\nHe met a poor man just outside the hotel selling matches, in rags.\\nAylmer gave him three hundred francs. He pretended to himself that he\\ndidn't want any more French money. He felt he wanted someone else to be\\nhappy too.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nA Contretemps\\n\\nEdith did not know, herself, what had induced her to write that letter\\nto Paris. Some gradual obscure influence, in an impulsive moment of\\nweakness, a conventional dread of Paris for one's idol. Then, what\\nVincy told her had convinced her Aylmer was unhappy. She thought that\\nsurely there might be some compromise; that matters could be adjusted.\\nCouldn't they go on seeing each other just as friends? Surely both\\nwould be happier than separated? For, yes--there was no doubt she\\nmissed him, and longed to see him. Is there any woman in the world on\\nwhom a sincere declaration from a charming, interesting person doesn't\\nmake an impression, and particularly if that person goes away\\npractically the next day, leaving a blank? Edith had a high opinion of\\nher own strength of will. When she appeared weak it was on some subject\\nabout which she was indifferent. She took a great pride in her own\\nself-poise; her self-control, which was neither coldness nor density.\\nShe had made up her mind to bear always with the little irritations\\nBruce caused her; to guide him in the right direction; keep her\\ninfluence with him in order to be able to arrange everything about the\\nchildren just as she wished. The children were a deep and intense\\npreoccupation. To say she adored them is insufficient. Archie she\\nregarded almost as her greatest friend, Dilly as a pet; for both she\\nhad the strongest feeling that a mother could have. And yet the fact\\nremained that they did not nearly fill her life. With Edith's intellect\\nand temperament they could only fill a part.\\n\\nBending down to a lower stature of intelligence all day long would make\\none's head ache; standing on tiptoe and stretching up would do the\\nsame; one needs a contemporary and a comrade.\\n\\nPerhaps till Edith met Aylmer she had not quite realised what such real\\ncomradeship might mean, coupled with another feeling--not the\\nintellectual sympathy she had for Vincy, but something quite different.\\nWhen she recollected their last drive her heart beat quickly, and the\\nlittle memories of the few weeks of their friend-ship gave her\\nunwonted moments of sentiment. Above all, it was a real, solid\\nhappiness--an uplifting pleasure, to believe he was utterly devoted to\\nher. And so, in a moment of depression, a feeling of the sense of the\\nfutility of her life, she had, perhaps a little wantonly, written to\\nask him to come back. It is human to play with what one loves.\\n\\nShe thought she had a soft, tender admiration for him, that he had a\\ncharm for her; that she admired him. But she had not the slightest idea\\nthat on her side there was anything that could disturb her in any way.\\nAnd so that his sentiment, which she had found to be rather infectious,\\nshould never carry her away, she meant only to see him now and then; to\\nmeet again and be friends.\\n\\nAs soon as she had written the letter and sent it she felt again a\\ncheerful excitement. She felt sure he would come in a day or two.\\n\\nAylmer arrived, as I have said, eight hours after he received the\\nletter. His first intention was to ring her up, or to speak to Bruce on\\nthe telephone. But it so happened that it was engaged. This decided him\\nto have a short rest, and then go and surprise her with a visit. He\\nthought he would have lunch at one (he knew she always lunched with the\\nchildren at this hour), and would call on her unexpectedly at two,\\nbefore she would have time to go out. They might have a long talk; he\\nwould give her the books and things he had bought for her, and he would\\nhave the pleasure of surprising her and seeing on her face that first\\nlook that no-one can disguise, the look of real welcome.\\n\\nMerely to be back in the same town made him nearly wild with joy. How\\njolly London looked at the beginning of July! So gay, so full of life.\\nAnd then he read a letter in a writing he didn't know; it was from\\nMavis Argles, the friend of Vincy--the young art-student: Vincy had\\ngiven her his address some time ago--asking him for some special\\nprivilege which he possessed, to see some of the Chinese pictures in\\nthe British Museum. He was to oblige her with a letter to the museum.\\nShe would call for it. Vincy was away, and evidently she had by\\naccident chosen the day of Aylmer's return without knowing anything of\\nhis absence. She had never seen him in her life.\\n\\nAylmer was wandering about the half-dismantled house _desoeuvre_, with\\nnothing to do, restlessly counting the minutes till two in the\\nafternoon. He remembered the very little that Vincy had told him of\\nMavis; how proud she was and how hard up. He saw her through the\\nwindow. She looked pale and rather shabby. He told the servant to show\\nher in.\\n\\n'I've just this moment got your letter, Miss Argles. But, of course,\\nI'm only too delighted.'\\n\\n'Thank you. Mr Vincy said you'd give me the letter.'\\n\\nThe girl sat down stiffly on the edge of a chair. Vincy had said she\\nwas pretty. Aylmer could not see it. But he felt brimming over with\\nsympathy and kindness for her--for everyone, in fact.\\n\\nShe wore a thin light grey cotton dress, and a small grey hat; her hair\\nlooked rich, red, and fluffy as ever; her face white and rather thin.\\nShe looked about seventeen. When she smiled she was pretty; she had a\\nRossetti mouth; that must have been what Vincy admired. Aylmer had no\\nidea that Vincy did more than admire her very mildly.\\n\\n'Won't you let me take you there?' suggested Aylmer suddenly. He had\\nnothing on earth to do, and thought it would fill up the time. 'Yes!\\nI'll drive you there and show you the pictures. And then, wouldn't you\\ncome and have lunch? I've got an appointment at two.'\\n\\nShe firmly declined lunch, but consented that he should drive her, and\\nthey went.\\n\\nAylmer talked with the eagerness produced by his restless excitement\\nand she listened with interest, somewhat fascinated, as people always\\nwere, with his warmth and vitality.\\n\\nAs they were driving along Oxford Street Edith, walking with Archie,\\nsaw them clearly. She had been taking him on some mission of clothes.\\n(For the children only she went into shops.) He was talking with such\\nanimation that he did not see her, to a pale young girl with bright red\\nhair. Edith knew the girl by sight, knew perfectly well that she was\\nVincy's friend--there was a photograph of her at his rooms. Aylmer did\\nnot see her. After a start she kept it to herself. She walked a few\\nsteps, then got into a cab. She felt ill.\\n\\nSo Aylmer had never got her letter? He had been in London without\\ntelling her. He had forgotten her. Perhaps he was deceiving her? And he\\nwas making love obviously to that sickening, irritating red-haired fool\\n(so Edith thought of her), Vincy's silly, affected art-student.\\n\\nWhen Edith went home she had a bad quarter of an hour. She never even\\nasked herself what right she had to mind so much; she only knew it\\nhurt. A messenger boy at once, of course.\\n\\n'Dear Mr Ross,\\n\\nI saw you this morning. I wrote you a line to Paris, not knowing you\\nhad returned. When you get the note forwarded, will you do me the\\nlittle favour to tear it up unopened? I'm sure you will do this to\\nplease me.\\n\\n'We are going away in a day or two, but I don't know where. Please\\ndon't trouble to come and see me.\\n\\n'Good-bye.\\n\\n'EDITH OTTLEY.'\\n\\nAylmer left Miss Argles at the British Museum. When he went back, he\\nfound this letter.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nAn Extraordinary Afternoon\\n\\nAylmer guessed at once she had seen him driving. Being a man of sense,\\nand not an impossible hero in a feuilleton, instead of going away again\\nand leaving the misunderstanding to ripen, he went to the telephone,\\nendeavoured to get on, and to explain, in few words, what had obviously\\nhappened. To follow the explanation by an immediate visit was his plan.\\nThough, of course, slightly irritated that she had seen him under\\ncircumstances conveying a false impression, on the other hand he was\\ndelighted at the pique her letter showed, especially coming immediately\\nafter the almost tender letter in Paris.\\n\\nHe rang and rang (and used language), and after much difficulty getting\\nan answer he asked, '_Why he could not get on_' a pathetic question\\nasked plaintively by many people (not only on the telephone).\\n\\n'The line is out of order.'\\n\\nIn about twenty minutes he was at her door. The lift seemed to him\\npreternaturally slow.\\n\\n'Mrs Ottley?'\\n\\n'Mrs Ottley is not at home, sir.'\\n\\nAt his blank expression the servant, who knew him, and of course liked\\nhim, as they always did, offered the further information that Mrs\\nOttley had gone out for the whole afternoon.\\n\\n'Are the children at home, or out with Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'The children are out, sir, but not with Miss Townsend. They are\\nspending the day with their grandmother.'\\n\\n'Oh! Do you happen to know if Mr and Mrs Ottley will be at home to\\ndinner?'\\n\\n'I've heard nothing to the contrary, sir.'\\n\\n'May I come in and write a note?'\\n\\nHe went into the little drawing-room. It was intensely associated with\\nher. He felt a little emu.... There was the writing-table, there the\\nbookcase, the few chairs, the grey walls; some pale roses fading in a\\npewter vase.... The restfulness of the surroundings filled him, and\\nfeeling happier he wrote on the grey notepaper:\\n\\n'DEAR MRS OTTLEY,\\n\\nI arrived early this morning. I started, in fact, from Paris\\nimmediately after receiving a few lines you very kindly sent me there.\\nI'm so disappointed not to see you. Unless I hear to the contrary--and\\neven if I do, I think!--I propose to come round this evening about\\nnine, and tell you and Bruce all about my travels.\\n\\n'Excuse my country manners in thus inviting myself. But I know you will\\nsay no if you don't want me. And in that case I shall have to come\\nanother time, very soon, instead, as I really must see you and show you\\nsomething I've got for Archie. Yours always--'\\n\\nHe paused, and then added:\\n\\n'Sincerely,\\n\\n'AYLMER ROSS'\\n\\nHe went to his club, there to try and pass the time until the evening.\\nHe meant to go in the evening, even if she put him off again; and, if\\nthey were out, to wait until they returned, pretending he had not heard\\nfrom her again.\\n\\nHe was no better. He had been away six weeks and was rather more in\\nlove than ever. He would only see her--she _did_ want to see him before\\nthey all separated for the summer! He could not think further than of\\nthe immediate future; he would see her; they could make plans\\nafterwards. Of course, her letter was simply pique! She had given\\nherself away--twice--once in the angry letter, also in the previous\\none to Paris. Where was she now? What did it mean? Why did she go out\\nfor the whole afternoon? Where was she?\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAfter Edith had written and sent her letter to Aylmer in the morning,\\nMrs Ottley the elder came to fetch the children to dine, and Edith told\\nMiss Townsend to go for the afternoon. She was glad she would be\\nabsolutely alone.\\n\\n'Aren't you very well, dear Mrs Ottley?' asked this young lady, in her\\nsweet, sympathetic way.\\n\\nEdith was fond of her, and, by implication only, occasionally confided\\nin her on other subjects than the children. Today, however, Edith\\nanswered that she was _very_ well _indeed_, but was going to see about\\nthings before they went away. 'I don't know how we shall manage without\\nyou for the holidays, Miss Townsend. I think you had better come with\\nus for the first fortnight, if you don't mind much.'\\n\\nMiss Townsend said she would do whatever Edith liked. She could easily\\narrange to go with them at once. This was a relief, for just at this\\nmoment Edith felt as if even the children would be a burden.\\n\\nSweet, gentle Miss Townsend went away. She was dressed rather like\\nherself, Edith observed; she imitated Edith. She had the soft, graceful\\nmanner and sweet voice of her employer. She was slim and had a pretty\\nfigure, but was entirely without Edith's charm or beauty. Vaguely Edith\\nwondered if she would ever have a love affair, ever marry. She hoped\\nso, but (selfishly) not till Archie went to Eton.\\n\\nThen she found herself looking at her lonely lunch; she tried to eat,\\ngave it up, asked for a cup of tea.\\n\\nAt last, she could bear the flat no longer. It was a glorious day, very\\nhot, Edith felt peculiar. She thought that if she spent all the\\nafternoon out and alone, it would comfort her, and she would think it\\nout. Trees and sky and sun had always a soothing effect on her. She\\nwent out, walked a little, felt worried by the crowd of shoppers\\nswarming to Sloane Street and the Brompton Road, got into a taxi and\\ndrove to the gate of Kensington Gardens, opposite Kensington Gore. Here\\nshe soon found a seat. At this time of the day the gardens were rather\\nunoccupied, and in the burning July afternoon she felt almost as if in\\nthe country. She took off her gloves--a gesture habitual with her\\nwhenever possible. She looked utterly restful. She had nothing in her\\nhands, for she never carried either a parasol or a bag, nor even in\\nwinter a muff or in the evening a fan. All these little accessories\\nseemed unnecessary to her. She liked to simplify. She hated fuss,\\nanything worrying, agitating.\\n\\n... And now she felt deeply miserable, perturbed and agitated. What a\\npunishment for giving way to that half-coquettish, half self-indulgent\\nimpulse that had made her write to Paris! She had begged him to come\\nback; while, really, he was here, and had not even let her know. She\\nhad never liked what she had heard of Mavis Argles, but had vaguely\\npitied her, wondering what Vincy saw in her, and wishing to believe the\\nbest. Now, she assumed the worst! As soon as Vincy had gone out of\\ntown--he was staying in Surrey with some of his relatives--she, the\\nminx, began flirting or carrying on with Aylmer. How far had it gone?\\nshe wondered jealously. She did not believe Aylmer's love-making to be\\nharmless. He was so easily carried away. His feelings were impulsive.\\nYet it was only a very short time since Vincy had told her of Aylmer's\\nmiserable letter. Edith was not interested in herself, and seldom\\nthought much of her own feelings, but she hated self-deception; and now\\nshe faced facts. She adored Aylmer! It had been purely jealousy that\\nmade her write to Paris so touchingly, asking him to come back--vague\\nfears that, if he were so depressed in Spain, perhaps he might try by\\namusements to forget her in Paris. He had once said to her that, of all\\nplaces, he thought Paris the least attractive for a romance, because it\\nwas all so obvious, so prepared, so professional. He liked the\\nunexpected, the veiled and somewhat more hypocritical atmosphere, and\\nin the fogs of London, he had said, were more romantic mysteries than\\nin any other city. Still, she had feared. And besides she longed to see\\nhim. So she had unbent and thought herself soon after somewhat\\nreckless; it was a little wanton and unfair to bring him back. But she\\nwas not a saint; she was a woman; and sometimes Bruce was trying....\\n\\nEdith belonged to the superior class of human being whom jealousy\\nchills and cures, and does not stimulate to further efforts. It was not\\nin her to go in for competition. The moment she believed someone else\\ntook her place she relaxed her hold. This is the finer temperament, but\\nit suffers most.\\n\\nShe would not try to take Aylmer away. Let him remain with his\\nred-haired Miss Argles! He might even marry her. He deserved it.\\n\\nShe meant to tell Vincy, of course. Poor Vincy, _he_ didn't know of the\\ntreachery. Now she must devote herself to the children, and be good and\\nkind to Bruce. At least, Bruce was _true_ to her in his way.\\n\\nHe had been in love when they married, but Edith shrewdly suspected he\\nwas not capable of very much more than a weak rather fatuous sentiment\\nfor any woman. And anyone but herself would have lost him many years\\nago, would very likely have given him up. But she had kept it all\\ntogether, had really helped him, and was touched when she remembered\\nthat jealous scene he made about the letter. The letter she wouldn't at\\nfirst let him see. Poor Bruce! Well, they were linked together. There\\nwere Archie, the angel, and Dilly, the pet.... She was twenty-eight and\\nAylmer forty. He ought not to hold so strong a position in her mind.\\nBut he did. Yes, she was in love with him in a way--it was a mania, an\\nobsession. But she would now soon wrestle with it and conquer it. The\\ngreat charm had been his exclusive devotion--but also his appearance,\\nhis figure, his voice. He looked sunburnt and handsome. He was laughing\\nas he talked to the miserable creature (so Edith called her in her own\\nmind).\\n\\nThen Edith had a reaction. She would cure herself today! No more\\nflirtation, no more amitie amoureuse. They were going away. The\\nchildren, darlings, how they loved her! And Bruce. She was reminding\\nherself she must be gentle, good, to Bruce. He had at least never\\ndeceived her!\\n\\nShe got up and walked on and on. It was about five o'clock now. As she\\nwalked, she thought how fortunate she was in Miss Townsend; what a nice\\ngirl she was, what a good friend to her and the children. She had a\\nsort of intuition that made her always have the right word, the right\\nmanner. She had seemed a little odd lately, but she was quite pleased\\nto come with them to the country. What made her think of Miss Townsend?\\nSome way off was a girl, with her back to Edith, walking with a man.\\nHer figure was like Miss Townsend's, and she wore a dress like the one\\ncopied from Edith's. Edith walked more quickly, it was the retired part\\nof the gardens on the way towards the Bayswater Road. The two figures\\nturned down a flowery path.... It was Miss Townsend! She had turned her\\nface. Edith was surprised, was interested, and walked on a few steps.\\nShe had not seen the man clearly. Then they both sat down on a seat. He\\ntook her hand. She left it in his. There was something familiar in his\\nfigure and clothes, and Edith saw his face.\\n\\nYes, it was Bruce.\\n\\nEdith turned round and went home.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nJourneys End\\n\\nSo that was how Bruce behaved to her!\\n\\nThe deceit of both of them hurt her immensely. But she pulled herself\\ntogether. It was a case for action. She felt a bitter, amused contempt,\\nbut she felt it half-urgent _not_ to do anything that would lead to a\\nlife of miserable bickering and mutual harm.\\n\\nIt must be stopped. And without making Bruce hate her.\\n\\nShe wrote the second note of this strange day and sent it by a\\nmessenger.\\n\\nGiving no reason of any kind, she told the governess that she had\\ndecided the children's holidays should begin from that day, and that\\nshe was unexpectedly going away with them almost immediately, and she\\nadded that she would not require Miss Townsend any more. She enclosed a\\ncheque, and said she would send on some books and small possessions\\nthat Miss Townsend had kept there.\\n\\nThis was sent by a messenger to Miss Townsend's home near Westbourne\\nGrove. She would find it on her return from her walk!\\n\\nAnd now Edith read Aylmer's note--it was so real, so sincere, she began\\nto disbelieve her eyes this morning.\\n\\nIt gave her more courage; she wanted to be absolutely calm, and looking\\nher very best, for Bruce's entrance.\\n\\nHe came in with his key. He avoided her eye a little--looked rather\\nsheepish, she thought. It was about seven.\\n\\n'Hallo! Aren't the children in yet? Far too late for them to be out.'\\n'Nurse fetched Dilly. She has gone to bed. Archie is coming presently;\\nmother will send him all right.'\\n\\n'How are you, Edith, old girl?'\\n\\n'I'm quite well, Bruce.'\\n\\n'I have a sort of idea, as you know,' he said, growing more at ease,\\n'that we shall rather miss--a--Miss Townsend, when we first go away.\\nWhat do you think of taking her for part of the time?' 'Dinner's\\nready,' announced Edith, and they dined. Towards the end of dinner he\\nwas about to make the suggestion again, when Edith said in clear, calm\\nbut decided tones:\\n\\n'Bruce, I am not going to take Miss Townsend away with us. She is not\\ncoming any more.'\\n\\n'Not--Why? What the devil's the idea of this new scheme? What's the\\nmatter with Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'Bruce,' answered Edith, 'I prefer not to go into the question, and\\nlater you will be glad I did not. I've decided that Miss Townsend is\\nnot to come any more at all. I've written to tell her so. I'll look\\nafter the children with nurse until we come back.... It's all settled.'\\n\\nBruce was silent.\\n\\n'Well upon my word!' he exclaimed, looking at her uneasily. 'Have it\\nyour own way, of course--but upon my word! Why?'\\n\\n'Do you really want me to tell you exactly why? I would so much prefer\\nnot.'\\n\\n'Oh, all right, Edith dear; after all--hang it all--you're the\\nchildren's mother--it's for you to settle.... No, I don't want to know\\nanything. Have it as you wish.'\\n\\n'Then we won't discuss it again. Shall we?'\\n\\n'All right.'\\n\\nHe was looking really rather shamefaced, and she thought she saw a\\ngleam of remorse and also of relief in his eye. She went into the other\\nroom. She had not shown him Aylmer's letter.\\n\\nAfter ten minutes he came in and said: 'Look here, Edith. Make what\\narrangements you like. _I_ never want to see--Miss Townsend again.'\\n\\nShe looked a question.\\n\\n'And I never shall.'\\n\\nShe was really pleased at this, and held out her hand. Bruce had tears\\nin his eyes as he took it. 'Edith, old girl, I think I'll go round to\\nthe club for an hour or two.'\\n\\n'Do. And look here, Bruce, leave it to me to tell the children. They'll\\nforget after the holidays. Archie must not be upset.'\\n\\n'Whatever you do, Edith, will be--what I mean to say is that--Well,\\ngood night; I sha'n't be long.'\\n\\nEdith was really delighted, she felt she had won, and she _did_ want\\nthat horrid little Townsend to be scored off! Wasn't it natural? She\\nwanted to hear no more about it.\\n\\nThere was a ring. It was nine o'clock. It was Aylmer's voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nThe Great Exception\\n\\nThe absurdly simple explanation, made almost in dumb show, by action\\nrather than in dialogue, was soon given. He was surprised, simply\\nenchanted, at the entire frankness of her recognition; she acknowledged\\nopenly that it mattered to her tremendously whether or not he was on\\nintimate terms or flirting with little Miss Argles, or with little Miss\\nanybody. He was not even to look at any woman except herself, that was\\narranged between them now and understood. They were side by side, with\\nhands clasped as a matter of course, things taken for granted that he\\nformerly never dreamt of. The signs of emotion in her face he\\nattributed of course to the morning's contretemps, knowing nothing of\\nthe other trouble.\\n\\n'It's heavenly being here again. You're prettier than ever, Edith;\\nsweeter than ever. What a time I had away. It got worse and worse.'\\n\\n'Dear Aylmer!'\\n\\n'You're far too good and kind to me. But I _have_ suffered--awfully.'\\n\\n'So have I, since this morning. I felt--'\\n\\n'What did you feel? Tell me!'\\n\\n'Must I?'\\n\\n'Yes!'\\n\\n'I felt, when I saw you with her, as if I hadn't got a friend in the\\nworld. I felt quite alone. I felt as if the ground were going to open\\nand swallow me up. I relied on you so much, far more than I knew! I was\\nstruck dumb, and rooted to the spot, and knocked all of a heap, in a\\nmanner of speaking, as Vincy would say,' Edith went on, laughing. 'But\\nnow, you've cured me thoroughly; you're such a _real_ person.'\\n\\n'Angel!'\\n\\nShe still left her hand in his. Her eyes were very bright, the result\\nof few but salt tears, the corners of her mouth were lifted by a happy\\nsmile, not the tantalising, half-mocking smile he used to see. She was\\nchanged, and was, he thought, more lovable--prettier; today's emotion\\nhad shaken her out of herself. The reaction of this evening gave a\\nbrilliancy to her eyes, happy curves to her lips, and the slight\\ndisarrangement of her hair, not quite silky-smooth tonight, gave her a\\nmore irresponsible look. She seemed more careless--younger.\\n\\n'Where's Bruce?' Aylmer asked suddenly.\\n\\n'He's gone to the club. He'll be back rather soon, I should think.'\\n\\n'I won't wait. I would rather not meet him this evening. When shall I\\nsee you again?'\\n\\n'Oh, I don't know. I don't think I want to make any plans now.'\\n\\n'As you wish. I say, do you really think Vincy can care for that girl?'\\n\\n'I believe he has had a very long friendship of some kind with her.\\nHe's never told me actually, but I've felt it,' Edith said.\\n\\n'Is he in love with her? Can he be?'\\n\\n'In a way--in one of his peculiar ways.'\\n\\n'She's in love with him, I suppose,' said Aylmer. 'It was only because\\nshe thought it would please him that she wanted to see those things at\\nthe museum. I think she's a little anxious. I found her a wild,\\nirritating, unaccountable, empty creature. I believe she wants him to\\nmarry her.'\\n\\n'I hope he won't, unless he _really_ wants to,' said Edith. 'It would\\nbe a mistake for Vincy to sacrifice himself as much as that.'\\n\\n'I hope indeed he won't,' exclaimed Aylmer. 'And I think it's out of\\nthe question. Miss Argles is only an incident, surely. She looks the\\nslightest of episodes.'\\n\\n'It's a very long episode. It might end, though--if she insists and he\\nwon't.'\\n\\n'Oh, bother, never mind them!' Aylmer replied, with boyish impatience.\\n'Let me look at _you_ again. Do you care for me a little bit, Edith?'\\n\\n'Yes; I do.'\\n\\n'Well, what's going to be done about it?' he asked, with happy\\ntriviality.\\n\\n'Don't talk nonsense,' she replied. 'We're just going to see each other\\nsometimes.' 'I'll be satisfied with anything!' cried Aylmer, 'after\\nwhat I've suffered not seeing you at all. We'll have a new game. You\\nshall _make_ the rules and I'll keep them.'\\n\\n'Naturally.'\\n\\n'About the summer?'\\n\\n'Oh, no plans tonight. I must think.' She looked thoughtful.\\n\\n'Tell me, how's Archie?' he said.\\n\\n'Archie's all right--delightful. Dilly, too. But I'm rather bothered.'\\n\\n'Why should you bother? What's it about? Tell me at once.'\\n\\nShe paused a moment. 'Miss Townsend won't be able to come back any\\nmore,' she said steadily.\\n\\n'Really? What a pity. I suppose the fool of a girl's engaged, or\\nsomething.'\\n\\n'She won't come back any more,' answered Edith.\\n\\n'Will you have to get a new Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'I thought of being their governess myself--during the holidays,\\nanyhow.'\\n\\n'But that will leave you hardly any time--no leisure.'\\n\\n'Leisure for what?'\\n\\n'For anything--for me, for instance,' said Aylmer boldly. He was full\\nof the courage and audacity caused by the immense relief of seeing her\\nagain and finding her so responsive.\\n\\nThere is, of course, no joy so great as the cessation of pain; in fact\\nall joy, active or passive, is the cessation of some pain, since it\\nmust be the satisfaction of a longing, even perhaps an unconscious\\nlonging. A desire is a sort of pain, even with hope, without it is\\ndespair. When, for example, one takes artistic pleasure in looking at\\nsomething beautiful, that is a cessation of the pain of having been\\ndeprived of it until then, since what one enjoys one must have longed\\nfor even without knowing it.\\n\\n'Look here,' said Aylmer suddenly. 'I don't believe I can do without\\nyou.'\\n\\n'You said _I_ was to make the rules.'\\n\\n'Make them then; go on.'\\n\\n'Well, we'll be intimate friends, and meet as often as we can. Once a\\nweek you may say you care for me, and I'll say the same. That's all. If\\nyou find you don't like it--can't stand it, as you say--then you'll\\nhave to go away again.'\\n\\n'I agree to it all, to every word. You'll see if I don't stick to it\\nabsolutely.'\\n\\n'Thank you, dear Aylmer.'\\n\\nHe paused.\\n\\n'Then I mustn't kiss you?'\\n\\n'No. Never again.'\\n\\n'All right. Never again after tonight. Tonight is the great exception,'\\nsaid Aylmer.\\n\\nShe made a tardy and futile protest. Then she said:\\n\\n'Now, Aylmer, you must go.' She sighed. 'I have a lot of worries.'\\n\\n'I never heard you say that before. Let me take them and demolish them\\nfor you. Can't you give them to me?'\\n\\n'No; I shall give nothing more to you. Good-bye....\\n\\n'Remember, there are to be no more exceptions,' said Edith.\\n\\n'I promise.'\\n\\nShe sat quietly alone for half-an-hour, waiting for Bruce.\\n\\nShe now felt sorry for Bruce, utterly and completely indifferent about\\n'the Townsend case', as she already humorously called it to herself.\\nBut, she thought, she _must_ be strong! She was not prepared to lose\\nher dignity, nor to allow the children to be educated by a woman whose\\nfaith at least with them and in their home was unreliable; their\\nsurroundings must be crystal-clear. It would make a certain difference\\nto them, she thought. How could it not? There were so many little ways\\nin which she might spoil them or tease them, scamp things, or rush\\nthem, or be nicer to one of them, or less nice, if she had any sort of\\nconcealed relation with their father. And as she had been treated\\nabsolutely as a confidante by Edith, the girl had certainly shown\\nherself treacherous, and rather too clearly capable of dissimulation.\\nEdith thought this must have a bad effect on the children.\\n\\nEdith was essentially a very feminine woman though she had a mental\\nattitude rightly held to be more characteristic of men. Being so\\nfeminine, so enraged under her calm and ease, she was, of course, not\\ncompletely consistent. She was still angry, and very scornful of Miss\\nTownsend. She was hurt with her; she felt a friend had played her\\nfalse--a friend, too, in the position of deepest trust, of grave\\nresponsibility. Miss Townsend knew perfectly well what the children\\nwere to Edith, and, for all she knew, there was no-one in Edith's life\\nexcept Bruce; so that it was rather cruel. Edith intended to keep up\\nher dignity so absolutely that Miss Townsend could never see her again,\\nthat she could never speak to Edith on the subject. She wished also,\\n_very_ much, that Bruce should never see her again, but didn't know how\\nto encompass this. She must find a way.\\n\\nOn the other hand, after the first shock and disgust at seeing him,\\nEdith's anger with Bruce himself had entirely passed. Had she not\\nknown, for years, that he was a little weak, a little fatuous? He was\\njust as good a sort now as he had ever been, and as she was not blinded\\nby the resentment and fury of the real jealousy of passion, Edith saw\\nclearly, and knew that Bruce cared far more for _her_ than for anybody\\nelse; that in so far as he could love anybody he loved her in his way.\\nAnd she wanted to keep the whole thing together on account of Archie,\\nand for Dilly's sake. She must be so kind, yet so strong that Bruce\\nwould be at once grateful for her forbearance and afraid to take\\nadvantage of it. Rather a difficult undertaking!...\\n\\nAnd she had seen Aylmer again! There was nothing in it about Miss\\nArgles. What happiness! She ought to have trusted him. He cared for\\nher. He loved her. His sentiment was worth having. And she cared for\\nhim too; how much she didn't quite know. She admired him; he fascinated\\nher, and she also felt a deep gratitude because he gave her just the\\nsort of passionate worship that she must have always unconsciously\\ncraved for.\\n\\nCertainly the two little events of today had drawn her nearer to him.\\nShe had been far less reserved that evening. She closed her eyes and\\nsmiled to herself. But this mustn't happen again.\\n\\nWith a strong effort of self-coercion she banished all delightful\\nrecollections as she heard Bruce come up in the lift.\\n\\nHe came in with a slightly shy, uncomfortable manner. Again, she felt\\nsorry for him.\\n\\n'Hallo!' he said.\\n\\nHe gave her a quick glance, a sort of cautious look which made her feel\\nrather inclined to laugh. Then he said:\\n\\n'I've just been down to the club. What have you been doing?'\\n\\n'Aylmer's been here.'\\n\\n'Didn't know he was in town.'\\n\\n'He's only come for a few days.'\\n\\n'I should like to see him,' said Bruce, looking brighter. 'Did he ask\\nafter me?'\\n\\n'Yes.'\\n\\nHe looked at her again and said suspiciously:\\n\\n'I suppose you didn't mention--'\\n\\n'Mention what?'\\n\\n'Edith!'\\n\\n'Yes?'\\n\\nHe cleared his throat and then said with an effort of self-assertion\\nthat she thought at once ridiculous and touching:\\n\\n'Look here, I don't wish to blame you in any way for what--er--\\narrangements you like to make in your own household. But--er--have you\\nwritten to Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'Yes; she won't come back.'\\n\\n'Er--but won't she ask why?'\\n\\n'I hope not.'\\n\\n'Why?' asked Bruce, with a tinge of defiance.\\n\\n'Because then I should have to explain. And I don't like explaining.'\\n\\nThere was another pause. Bruce seemed to take a great interest in his\\nnails, which he examined separately one at a time, and then all\\ntogether, holding both hands in front of him.\\n\\n'Did Archie enjoy his day?'\\n\\n'Oh yes,' said Edith.\\n\\nBruce suddenly stood up, and a franker, more manly expression came into\\nhis face. He looked at her with a look of pain. Tears were not far from\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n'Edith, you're a brick. You're too good for me.'\\n\\nShe looked down and away without answering.\\n\\n'Look here, is there anything I can do to please you?'\\n\\n'Yes, there is.'\\n\\n'What? I'll do it, whatever it is, on my word of honour.'\\n\\n'Well, it's a funny thing to ask you, but you know our late governess,\\nMiss Townsend? I should like you to promise never to see her again,\\neven by accident. If you meet her--by accident, I mean--I want you not\\nto see her.'\\n\\nBruce held out both his hands.\\n\\n'I swear I'd never recognise her even if I should meet her\\naccidentally.'\\n\\n'I know it's a very odd thing to ask,' continued Edith, 'just a fancy;\\nwhy should I mind your not seeing Miss Townsend?'\\n\\nHe didn't answer.\\n\\n'However, I _do_ mind, and I'll be grateful.'\\n\\nEdith thought one might be unfaithful without being disloyal, and she\\nbelieved Bruce now. She was too sensible to ask him never to write a\\nline, never to telephone, never to do anything else; besides, it was\\nbeneath her dignity to go into these details, and common-sense told her\\nthat one or the other must write or communicate if the thing was to be\\nstopped. If Miss Townsend wrote to him to the club, he would have to\\nanswer. Bruce meant not to see her again, and that was enough.\\n\\n'Then you're not cross, Edith--not depressed?'\\n\\nShe gave her sweetest smile. She looked brilliantly happy and\\nparticularly pretty.\\n\\n'Edith!'\\n\\nWith a violent reaction of remorse, and a sort of tenderness, he tried\\nto put his arm round her. She moved away.\\n\\n'Don't you forgive me, Edith, for anything I've done that you don't\\nlike?'\\n\\n'Yes, I _entirely_ forgive you. The incident is closed.'\\n\\n'Really forgive me?'\\n\\n'Absolutely. And I've had a tiring day and I'm going to sleep. Good\\nnight.'\\n\\nWith a kind little nod she left him standing in the middle of the room\\nwith that air of stupid distinction that he generally assumed when in a\\nlift with other people, and that came to his rescue at awkward\\nmoments--a dull, aloof, rather haughty expression. But it was no use to\\nhim now.\\n\\nHe had considerable difficulty in refraining from venting his temper on\\nthe poor, dumb furniture; in fact, he did give a kick to a pretty\\nlittle writing-table. It made no sound, but its curved shoulder looked\\nresentful.\\n\\n'What a day!' said Bruce to himself.\\n\\nHe went to his room, pouting like Archie. But he knew he had got off\\ncheaply.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nAnother Side of Bruce\\n\\nEver since his earliest youth, Bruce had always had, at intervals, some\\nvague, vain, half-hearted entanglement with a woman. The slightest\\ninterest, practically even common civility, shown him by anyone of the\\nfeminine sex between the ages of sixteen and sixty, flattered his\\nvanity to such an extraordinary extent that he immediately thought\\nthese ladies were in love with him, and it didn't take much more for\\nhim to be in love with them. And yet he didn't really care for women.\\nWith regard to them his point of view was entirely that of vanity, and\\nin fact he only liked both men or women who made up to him, or who gave\\nhim the impression that they did. Edith was really the only woman for\\nwhom his weak and flickering passion had lingered at all long; and in\\naddition to that (the first glamour of which had faded) she had a real\\nhold over him. He felt for her the most genuine fondness of which he\\nwas capable, besides trust and a certain admiration. A sort of respect\\nunderlay all his patronising good-nature or caprices with her. But\\nstill he had got into the habit of some feeble flirtation, a little\\naffair, and at first he missed it very much. He didn't care a straw for\\nMiss Townsend; he never had. He thought her plain and tedious; she\\nbored him more than any woman he had ever met, and yet he had slipped\\ninto a silly sort of intrigue, beginning by a few words of pity or\\nsympathy to her, and by the idea that she looked up to him in\\nadmiration. He was very much ashamed of it and of the circumstances; he\\nwas not proud of his conquest with her, as he generally was. He felt\\nthat on account of the children, and altogether, he had been playing it\\na bit low down.\\n\\nHe was not incapable, either, of appreciating Edith's attitude. She had\\nnever cross-questioned him, never asked him for a single detail, never\\nlaboured the subject, nor driven the point home, nor condescended even\\nto try to find out how far things had really gone. She hadn't even told\\nhim how she knew; he was ashamed to ask.\\n\\nAnd, after that promise of forgiveness, she never referred to it; there\\nwas never the slightest innuendo, teasing, reproach. Yes, by Jove!\\nEdith was wonderful! And so Bruce meant to play the game too.\\n\\nFor several days he asked the porter at the club if there were any\\nletters, receiving the usual reply, 'None, sir.'\\n\\nThe third day he received the following note, and took it to read with\\nenjoyment of the secrecy combined with a sort of self-important shame.\\nUntil now he hadn't communicated with her:--\\n\\n'Dear Mr Ottley,\\n\\nOf course you know I'm not returning to the children after the\\nholidays, nor am I going with you to Westgate. I'm very unhappy, for I\\nfear I have offended Mrs Ottley. She has always been very kind to me\\ntill now; but I shall let the matter rest. Under the circumstances I\\nsuppose I shall not see you any more. May I ask that you should not\\ncall or write. I and mother are going to spend the summer at Bexhill\\nwith some friends. Our address will be Sandringham, Seaview Road,\\nBexhill, if you like to write just one line to say good-bye. I fear I\\nhave been rather to blame in seeing you without Mrs Ottley's knowledge,\\nbut you know how one's feelings sometimes lead one to do what one knows\\none ought not to ...'\\n\\n'Sandringham, indeed! Some boarding house, I suppose,' said Bruce to\\nhimself. 'What a lot of 'ones'!... Fine grammar for a governess.'\\n\\n'... Wishing you every happiness (I _shall_ miss the children!).\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMargaret Townsend\\n\\n'_P.S._--I shall never forget how happy I was with you and Mrs Ottley.'\\n\\nBruce's expression as he read the last line was rather funny.\\n\\n'She's a silly little fool, and I shan't answer,' he reflected.\\n\\nRe-reading the letter, he found it more unsatisfactory still, and\\ndestroyed it.\\n\\nThe thought of Miss Townsend bored him unutterably; and indeed he was\\nincapable of caring for any woman (however feebly) for more than two or\\nthree weeks. He was particularly fickle, vague, and scrappy in his\\nemotions. Edith was the only woman for whom even a little affection\\ncould last, and he would have long tired of her but for her exceptional\\ncharacter and the extraordinary trouble and tact she used with him. He\\ndidn't appreciate her fine shades, he was not in love with her, didn't\\nvalue her as another man might have done. But he was always coming back\\nto a certain steady, renewed feeling of tenderness for her.\\n\\nWith the curious blindness common to all married people (and indeed to\\nany people who live together), clever Edith had been entirely taken in,\\nin a certain sense; she had always felt (until the 'Townsend case')\\nhalf disdainfully but satisfactorily certain of Bruce's fidelity. She\\nknew that he had little sham flirtations, but she had never imagined\\nhis going anywhere near an intrigue. She saw now that in that she had\\nbeen duped, and that if he didn't do more it was not from loyalty to\\nher. Still, she now felt convinced that it wouldn't occur again. She\\nhad treated him well; she had spared him in the matter. He was a little\\ngrateful, and she believed he would be straight now, though her opinion\\nof him had rather gone down. Edith always felt that she must go to the\\nvery extreme of loyalty to anyone who was faithful to her; she valued\\nfidelity so deeply, and now this feeling was naturally relaxed a\\nlittle. She hadn't the slightest desire for revenge, but she felt she\\nhad a slightly freer hand. She didn't see why she should, for instance,\\ndeprive herself of the pleasure of seeing Aylmer; she had not told him\\nanything about it.\\n\\nThat day at the club, Bruce in his depression had a chat with\\nGoldthorpe, his golfing companion and sometime confidant. Over a\\ncigarette and other refreshments, Bruce murmured how he had put an end\\nto the little affair for the sake of his wife.\\n\\n'Rather jolly little girl, she was.'\\n\\n'Oh yes,' said Goldthorpe indifferently. He thought Edith very\\nattractive, and would have liked to have the duty of consoling her.\\n\\n'One of those girls that sort of _get round_ you, and appeal to\\nyou--_you_ know.'\\n\\n'Oh yes.'\\n\\n'Grey eyes--no, by Jove! I should call them hazel, with black lashes,\\nno, not exactly black--brown. Nice, white teeth, slim figure--perhaps\\na bit too straight. Brownish hair with a tinge of gold in the sun.'\\n\\n'Oh yes.'\\n\\n'About twenty,' continued Bruce dreamily. He knew that Miss Townsend\\nwas thirty-two, but suspected Goldthorpe of admiring flappers, and so,\\nwith a subconscious desire to impress him, rearranged the lady's age.\\n\\n'About twenty--if that. Rather long, thin hands--the hands of a lady.\\nWell, it's all over now.'\\n\\n'That's all right,' said Goldthorpe. He seemed to have had enough of\\nthis retrospective inventory. He looked at his watch and found he had\\nan appointment.\\n\\nBruce, thinking he seemed jealous, smiled to himself.\\n\\nFor a few days after what had passed there was a happy reaction in the\\nhouse. Everyone was almost unnaturally sweet and polite and unselfish\\nabout trifles to everybody else. Edith was devoting herself to the\\nchildren, Bruce had less of her society than usual. She seemed to\\nassume they were to be like brother and sister. He wouldn't at present\\nraise the question; thinking she would soon get over such a rotten\\nidea. Besides, a great many people had left town; and they were,\\nthemselves, in the rather unsettled state of intending to go away in a\\nfortnight. Though happy at getting off so easily, Bruce was really\\nmissing the meetings and notes (rather than the girl).\\n\\nFortunately, Vincy now returned; he was looking sunburnt and happy. He\\nhad been having a good time. Yet he looked a little anxious\\noccasionally, as if perplexed.\\n\\nOne day he told Edith that he had just had a rather serious quarrel\\nwith someone who was awfully cross, and carried on like anything and\\nwouldn't give over.\\n\\n'I guess who she is. What does she want you to do?'\\n\\n'She wants me to do what all my relations are always bothering me to\\ndo,' said Vincy, 'only with a different person.'\\n\\n'What, to marry?'\\n\\n'Yes.'\\n\\n'To marry her, I suppose? Shall you?'\\n\\n'I'm afraid not,' he said. 'I don't think I quite can.'\\n\\n'Don't you think it would be rather unkind to her?'\\n\\nNeither of them had mentioned Miss Argles' name. The fact that Vincy\\nreferred to it at all showed her that he had recovered from his\\ninfatuation.\\n\\n'But do you think I'm treating the poor girl badly?'\\n\\n'Vincy, even if you adored her it would end unhappily. As you don't,\\nyou would both be miserable from the first day. Be firm. Be nice and\\nkind to her and tell her straight out, and come and stay with us in the\\ncountry.'\\n\\n'Well, that was rather my idea. Oh, but, Edith, it's hard to hurt\\nanyone.'\\n\\n'You know I saw her driving with Aylmer that day, and I thought he\\nliked her. I found I was wrong.'\\n\\n'Yes. He doesn't. I wish I could get some nice person to--er--take\\nher out. I mean, take her on.'\\n\\n'What sort of person? She's pretty in her way. I daresay she'll attract\\nsomeone.'\\n\\n'What sort of person? Oh, I don't know. Some nice earl would please\\nher, or one of those artist chaps you read of in the feuilletons--the\\nsort of artist who, when he once gets a tiny little picture skied at\\nthe Academy, immediately has fortune, and titles and things, rolling\\nin. A little picture called 'Eventide' or 'Cows by Moonlight', or\\nsomething of that sort, in those jolly stories means ten thousand\\npounds a year at once. Jolly, isn't it?'\\n\\n'Yes, Vincy dear, but we're not living in a feuilleton. What's really\\ngoing to be done? Will she be nasty?'\\n\\n'No. But I'm afraid Aunt Jessie will abuse me something cruel.' He\\nthought a little while. 'In fact she has.'\\n\\n'What does she say?'\\n\\n'She says I'm no gentleman. She said I had no business to lead the poor\\ngirl on, in a manner of speaking, and walk out with her, and pay her\\nmarked attention, and then not propose marriage like a gentleman.'\\n\\n'Then you're rather unhappy just now, Vincy?'\\n\\n'Well, I spoke to _her_ frankly, and said I would like to go on being\\nher friend, but I didn't mean to marry. And _she_ said she'd never see\\nme again unless I did.'\\n\\n'And what else?'\\n\\n'That's about all, thanks very much,' said Vincy.\\n\\nHere Bruce came in.\\n\\n'Edith,' he said,' have you asked Aylmer to come and stay with us at\\nWestgate?'\\n\\n'Oh no. I think I'd rather not.'\\n\\n'Why on earth not? How absurd of you. It's a bit selfish, dear, if\\nyou'll excuse my saying so. It's all very well for you: you've got the\\nchildren and Vincy to amuse you (you're coming, aren't you, Vincy?).\\nWhat price me? I must have someone else who can go for walks and play\\ngolf, a real pal, and so forth. I need exercise, and intellectual\\nsympathy. Aylmer didn't say he had anywhere else to go.'\\n\\n'He's going to take his boy, Freddie, away to some seaside place. He\\ndoesn't like staying with people.'\\n\\n'All right, then. I shall go and ask him to come and stay at the hotel,\\nfor at least a fortnight. I shall go and ask him now. You're\\ninconsistent, Edith. At one moment you seem to like the man, but as\\nsoon as I want to make a pleasant arrangement you're off it. So like a\\nwoman, isn't it, Vincy?' He laughed.\\n\\n'Isn't it?' answered Vincy.\\n\\n'Well, look here, I'm going right down to Jermyn Street purposely to\\ntell him. I'll be back to dinner; do stop, Vincy.'\\n\\nBruce was even more anxious than he used to be always to have a third\\nperson present whenever possible.\\n\\nHe walked through the hot July streets with that feeling of flatness\\n--of the want of a mild excitement apart from his own home. He saw\\nAylmer and persuaded him to come.\\n\\nWhile he was there a rather pretty pale girl, with rough red hair, was\\nannounced. Aylmer introduced Miss Argles.\\n\\n'I only came for a minute, to bring back those books, Mr Ross,' she\\nsaid shyly. 'I can't stop.'\\n\\n'Oh, thank you so much,' said Aylmer. 'Won't you have tea?'\\n\\n'No, nothing. I _must_ go at _once_. I only brought you in the books\\nmyself to show you they were safe.'\\n\\nShe gave a slightly coquettish glance at Aylmer, a half-observant\\nglance at Bruce, sighed heavily and went away. She was dressed in green\\nserge, with a turned-down collar of black lace. She wore black suede\\ngloves, a gold bangle and a smart and pretty hat, the hat Vincy\\npretended had been given to _him_ by Cissie Cavanack, his entirely\\nimaginary cousin, and which he'd really bought for her in Bond Street.\\n\\n'Well, I'll be off then. I'll tell Edith you'll write for rooms. Look\\nsharp about it, because they soon go at the best hotels.'\\n\\n'At any rate I'll bring Freddie down for a week,' said Aylmer, 'and\\nthen we'll see.'\\n\\n'Who is that girl?' asked Bruce, as he left.\\n\\n'She's a young artist, and I lent her some books of old prints she\\nwanted. She's not a particular friend of mine--I don't care for her\\nmuch.'\\n\\nBruce didn't hear the last words, for he was flying out of the door.\\nMiss Argles was walking very slowly; he joined her.\\n\\n'Pardon me,' he said, raising his hat. 'It's so very hot--am I going\\nyour way? Would you allow me to see you home?'\\n\\n'Oh, you're very kind, I'm sure,' she said sadly. 'But I don't think--I\\nlive at Ravenscourt Park.'\\n\\nBruce thought there was plenty of time.\\n\\n'Why how very curious! That's just where I was going,' said he boldly.\\n\\nHe put up his stick. Instead of a taxi a hansom drove up. Bruce hailed\\nit.\\n\\n'Always like to give these chaps a turn when I can,' he said. It would\\ntake longer.\\n\\n'How kind-hearted you are,' murmured the girl. 'But I'd really rather\\nnot, thank you.'\\n\\n'Then how shall you get back?'\\n\\n'Walk to the Tube.'\\n\\n'Oh no; it's far too hot. Let me drop you, as I'm going in your\\ndirection.'\\n\\nHe gave her a rather fixed look of admiration, and smiled. She gave a\\nslight look back and got into the cab.\\n\\n'What ripping red hair,' said Bruce to himself as he followed her.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBefore the end of the drive, which for him was a sort of adventure,\\nMavis had promised to meet Bruce when she left her Art School next\\nTuesday at a certain tea-shop in Bond Street.\\n\\nBruce went home happy and in good spirits again. There was no earthly\\nharm in being kind to a poor little girl like this. He might do a great\\ndeal of good. She seemed to admire him. She thought him so clever.\\nFunny thing, there was no doubt he had the gift; women liked him, and\\nthere you are. Look at Miss Mooney at the Mitchells' the other day,\\nwhy, she was ever so nice to him; went for him like one o'clock; but he\\ngave her no encouragement. Edith was there. He wouldn't worry her, dear\\ngirl.\\n\\nAs he came towards home he smiled again. And Edith, dear Edith--she,\\ntoo, must be frightfully keen on him, when one came to think about it,\\nto forgive him so readily about Margaret Tow--Oh, confound Miss\\nTownsend. This girl was a picture, a sort of Rossetti, and she had had\\nsuch trouble lately--terrible trouble. The man she had been devoted to\\nfor years had suddenly thrown her over, heartlessly.... What a brute he\\nmust have been! She was going to tell him all about it on Tuesday. That\\nman must have been a fiend!...\\n\\n'Holloa, Vincy! So glad you're still here. Let's have dinner, Edie.'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nAt Lady Everard's\\n\\nLady Everard was sitting in her favourite attitude at her\\nwriting-table, with her face turned to the door. She had once been\\nphotographed at her writing-table, with a curtain behind her, and her\\nface turned to the door. The photograph had appeared in _The Queen, The\\nLadies' Field, The Sketch, The Taller, The Bystander, Home Chat, Home\\nNotes, The Woman at Home_, and _Our Stately Homes of England_. It was a\\nfavourite photograph of hers; she had taken a fancy to it, and\\ntherefore she always liked to be found in this position. The photo had\\nbeen called: 'Lady Everard at work in her Music-Room.'\\n\\nWhat she was supposed to be working at, heaven only knew; for she never\\nwrote a line of anything, and even her social notes and invitation\\ncards were always written by her secretary.\\n\\nAs soon as a visitor came in, she rose from the suspiciously clean\\nwriting-table, put down the dry pen on a spotless blotter, went and sat\\nin a large brocaded arm-chair in front of some palms, within view of\\nthe piano, and began to talk. The music-room was large, splendid and\\nelaborately decorated. There was a frieze all round, representing\\nvariously coloured and somewhat shapeless creatures playing what were\\nsupposed to be musical instruments. One, in a short blue skirt, was\\nblowing at something; another in pink drapery (who squinted) was\\nstrumming on a lyre; other figures were in white, with their mouths\\nopen like young birds preparing to be fed by older birds. They\\nrepresented Harmony in all its forms. There were other attempts at the\\nclassical in the decoration of the room; but Lady Everard herself had\\nreduced this idea to bathos by huge quantities of signed photographs in\\nsilver frames, by large waste-paper baskets, lined with blue satin and\\ntrimmed with pink rosettes, by fans which were pockets, stuffed cats\\nwhich were paperweights, oranges which were pincushions, and other\\ndebris from those charitable and social bazaars of which she was a\\nconstant patroness.\\n\\nWith her usual curious combination of weak volubility and decided\\nlaying-down of the law, she was preparing to hold forth to young La\\nFrance (whom she expected), on the subject of Debussy, Edvina, Marcoux,\\nthe appalling singing of all his young friends, his own good looks, and\\nother subjects of musical interest, when Mr Cricker was announced.\\n\\nShe greeted him with less eagerness, if less patronage, than her other\\nprotege, but graciously offered him tea and permitted a cigarette.\\n\\nLady Everard went in for being at once _grande dame_ and Bohemian. She\\nwas truly good-natured and kind, except to rivals in her own sphere,\\nbut when jealous she was rather redoubtable.\\n\\n'I'm pleased to see you, my dear Willie,' she said; 'all the more\\nbecause I hear Mrs Mitchell has taken Wednesdays now. Not _quite_ a\\nnice thing to do, I think; although, after all, I suppose we could\\nhardly really clash. True, we _do_ happen to know a few of the same\\npeople.' (By that Lady Everard meant she had snatched as many of Mrs\\nMitchell's friends away as she thought desirable.) 'But as a general\\nrule I suppose we're not really in the same set. But perhaps you're\\ngoing on there afterwards?'\\n\\nThat had been Mr Clicker's intention, but he denied it, with surprise\\nand apparent pain at the suspicion.\\n\\nShe settled down more comfortably.\\n\\n'Ah, well, Mrs Mitchell is an extremely nice, hospitable woman, and her\\nparties are, I know, considered _quite_ amusing, but I do think--I\\nreally do--that her husband carries his practical jokes and things a\\n_little_ too far. It isn't good form, it really isn't, to see a man of\\nhis age, with his face blacked, coming in after dinner with a banjo,\\ncalling himself the Musical White-eyed Kaffir, as he did the last time\\nI was there. I find it _deplace_--that's the word, _deplace_. He seemed\\nto think that we were all children at a juvenile party! I was saying so\\nto Lord Rye only last night. Lord Rye likes it, I think, but he says Mr\\nMitchell's mad--that's what it is, a little mad. Last time Lord Rye was\\nthere everybody had a present given them hidden in their table napkins.\\nThere had been some mistake in the parcels, I believe, and Miss\\nMooney--you know, the actress, Myra Mooney--received a safety razor,\\nand Lord Rye a vanity bag. Everybody screamed with laughter, but I must\\nsay it seemed to me rather silly. I wasn't there myself.'\\n\\n'I was,' said Mr Cricker. 'I got a very pretty little feather fan. I\\nsuppose the things really had been mixed up, and after all I was very\\nglad of the fan; I was able to give it to--' He stopped, sighed and\\nlooked down on the floor.\\n\\n'And is that affair still going on, Willie dear? It seems to me _such_\\na pity. I _do_ wish you would try and give it up.'\\n\\n'I know, but she _won't_,' he said in a voice hoarse with anxiety.\\n'Dear Lady Everard, you're a woman of the world, and know everything--'\\n\\nShe smiled. 'Not everything, Willie; a little of music, perhaps. I know\\na good voice when I hear it. I have a certain _flair_ for what's going\\nto be a success in that direction, and of course I've been everywhere\\nand seen everything. I've a certain natural knowledge of life, too, and\\nkeep well up to date with everything that's going on. I knew about the\\nHendon Divorce Case long before anyone else, though it never came off\\nafter all, but that's not the point. But then I'm so discreet; people\\ntell me things. At any rate, I always _know_.'\\n\\nIndeed, Lady Everard firmly believed herself to be a great authority on\\nmost subjects, but especially on contemporary gossip. This was a\\ndelusion. In reality she had that marvellous talent for not knowing\\nthings, that gift for ignorance, and genius for inaccuracy so\\nfrequently seen in that cultured section of society of which she was so\\npopular and distinguished a member. It is a talent that rarely fails to\\nplease, particularly in a case like her own. There is always a certain\\nsatisfaction in knowing that a woman of position and wealth, who plumes\\nherself on her early knowledge and special information, is absolutely\\nand entirely devoid of the one and incorrect in the other. A marked\\nignorance in a professionally well-informed person has always something\\ntouching and appealing to those who are able, if not willing, to set\\nthat person right. It was taken for granted among her acquaintances,\\nand probably was one of the qualities that endeared her to them most,\\nthat dear Lady Everard was generally positive and always wrong.\\n\\n'Yes, I do know most things, perhaps,' she said complacently. 'And one\\nthing I know is that this woman friend of yours is making you perfectly\\nmiserable. You're longing to shake it off. Ah, I know you! You've far\\nmore real happiness in going to the opera with me than even in seeing\\nher, and the more she pursues you the less you like it. Am I not\\nright?'\\n\\n'Yes, I suppose so. But as a matter of fact, Lady Everard, if she\\ndidn't--well--what you might call make a dash for it, I shouldn't worry\\nabout her at all.'\\n\\n'Men,' continued Lady Everard, not listening, 'only like coldness;\\ncoldness, reserve. The only way in the world to draw a man on is to be\\nalways out to him, or to go away, and never even let him hear your name\\nmentioned.'\\n\\n'I daresay there's a lot in that,' said Cricker, wondering why she did\\nnot try that plan with young La France.\\n\\n'Women of the present day,' she continued, growing animated, 'make such\\na terrible, terrible mistake I What do they do when they like a young\\nman? Oh, I know! They write to him at his club; they call at his rooms\\nand leave messages; they telephone whenever they can. The more he\\ndoesn't answer their invitations the more they invite him. It's\\nappalling! And what's the result? Men are becoming cooler and cooler--\\nas a class, I mean. Of course, there are exceptions. But it's such a\\nmistake of women to run after the few young men there are. There are\\nsuch a tremendous lot of girls and married women nowadays, there are so\\nmany more of them.'\\n\\n'Well, perhaps that's why they do it,' said Cricker rather stupidly.\\n'At any rate--oh, well, I know if my friend hadn't been so jolly nice\\nto me at first and kept it up so--oh, well, you know what I mean--kept\\non keeping on, if I may use the expression, I should have drifted away\\nfrom her ages ago. Because, you see, supposing I'm beginning to think\\nabout something else, or somebody else, she doesn't stand it; she won't\\nstand it. And the awkward part is, you see, her being _on_ the stage\\n_and_ married makes the whole thing about as awkward as a case of that\\nsort can possibly be.'\\n\\n'I would not ask you her name for the world,' said Lady Everard\\nsmoothly. 'Of course I know she's a beautiful young comedy actress, or\\nis it tragedy? I wonder if I could guess her first name? Will you tell\\nme if I guess right?' She looked arch.\\n\\n'Oh, I say, I can't tell you who it is, Lady Everard; really not.'\\n\\n'Only the first name? I don't _want_ you to tell me; I'm discretion\\nitself, I prefer not to know. The Christian name is not Margaretta, is\\nit? Ah! no, I thought not. It's Irene Pettifer! There, I've guessed.\\nThe fact is, I always knew it, my dear boy. Your secret is safe with\\nme. I'm the tomb! I--'\\n\\n'Excuse me, Lady Everard,' said Cricker, with every sign of annoyance,\\n'it's no more Irene Pettifer than it's you yourself. Please believe me.\\nFirst of all I don't _know_ Irene Pettifer; I've never even seen her\\nphotograph--she's not young, not married, and an entirely different\\nsort of person.'\\n\\n'What did I tell you? I knew it wasn't; I only said that to draw you.\\nHowever, have a little more tea, or some iced coffee, it's so much more\\nrefreshing I always think. My dear Willie, I was only chaffing you. I\\nknew perfectly well it wasn't either of the people I suggested. The\\npoint is, it seems to prey on your mind, and worry you, and you won't\\nbreak it off.'\\n\\n'But how can I?'\\n\\n'I will dictate you a letter,' she said. 'Far be it from me to\\ninterfere, and I don't pretend to know more about this sort of thing\\nthan anybody else. At the same time, if you'll take it down just as I\\ntell it, and send it off, you'll find it will do admirably. Have you\\ngot a pencil?'\\n\\nAs if dully hypnotised, he took out a pencil and notebook.\\n\\n'It would be awfully kind of you, Lady Everard. It might give me an\\nidea anyway.'\\n\\n'All right.'\\n\\nShe leant back and half closed her eyes, as if in thought; then started\\nup with one finger out.\\n\\n'We must be quick, because I'm expecting someone presently,' she said.\\n'But we've got time for this. Now begin. July 7th, 1912. Have you got\\nthat?'\\n\\n'Yes, I've got that.'\\n\\n'Or, perhaps, just Thursday. Thursday looks more casual, more full of\\nfeeling than the exact date. Got Thursday?'\\n\\n'Yes, but it isn't Thursday, it's Friday.'\\n\\n'All right, Friday, or any day you like. The day is not the point. You\\ncan send it tomorrow, or any time you like. Wednesday. My dearest\\nIrene.'\\n\\n'Her name's not Irene.'\\n\\n'Oh no, I forgot. Take that out. Dear Margaretta. Circumstances have\\noccurred since I last had the pleasure of seeing you that make it\\nabsolutely impossible that I could ever meet you again.'\\n\\n'Oh, I say!'\\n\\n'Go on. Ever see you or meet you again. You wish to be kind to her, I\\nsuppose?'\\n\\n'Oh yes.'\\n\\n'Then say: Duty has to come between us, but God knows I wish you well.'\\nTears were beginning to come to Lady Everard's eyes, and she spoke with\\na break in her voice. 'I wish you well, Irene.'\\n\\n'It's not Irene.'\\n\\n'I wish you well, Margaretta. Some day in the far distant future you'll\\nthink of me, and be thankful for what I have done. It's for your good\\nand my own happiness that we part now, and for ever. Adieu, and may God\\nbless you. How do you sign yourself?'\\n\\n'Oh, Willie.'\\n\\n'Very well then, be more serious this time: Always your faithful\\nfriend, William Stacey Cricker.'\\n\\nHe glanced over the note, his face falling more and more, while Lady\\nEverard looked more and more satisfied.\\n\\n'Copy that out, word for word, the moment you go back, and send it\\noff,' she said, 'and all the worst of your troubles will be over.'\\n\\n'I should think the worst is yet to come,' said he ruefully.\\n\\n'But you promise to do it, Willie? Oh, promise me?'\\n\\n'Oh yes rather,' said he half-heartedly.\\n\\n'Word for word?'\\n\\n'O Lord, yes. That's to say, unless anything--'\\n\\n'Not a word, Willie; it will be your salvation. Come and see me soon,\\nand tell me the result. Ah! here you are, cher maitre!'\\n\\nWith a bright smile she welcomed Mr La France, who was now announced,\\ngently dismissing Willie with a push of the left hand.\\n\\n'Good heavens!' he said to himself, as he got into the cab, 'why, if I\\nwere to send a thing like that there would be murder and suicide! She'd\\nshow it to her husband, and he'd come round and knock me into a cocked\\nhat for it. Dear Lady Everard--she's a dear, but she doesn't know\\nanything about anything.'\\n\\nHe tore the pages out of his pocket-book, and called out to the cabman\\nthe address of the Mitchells.\\n\\n'Ah, chere madame, que je suis fatigue!' exclaimed La France, as he\\nthrew himself back against the cushions.\\n\\nHis hair was long and smooth and fair, so fair that he had been spoken\\nof by jealous singers as a peroxide blond. His eyes were greenish, and\\nhe had dark eyebrows and eyelashes. He was good-looking. His voice in\\nspeaking was harsh, but his manner soft and insidious. His talents were\\ncosmopolitan; his tastes international; he had no duties, few pleasures\\nand that entire want of leisure known only to those who have\\npractically nothing whatever to do.\\n\\n'Fatigued? That's what you always say,' said Lady Everard, laughing.\\n\\n'But it is always true,' he said, with a strong French accent.\\n\\n'You should take more exercise, Paul. Go out more in the air. You lead\\ntoo secluded a life.'\\n\\n'What exercises? I practise my voice every day, twenty minutes.'\\n\\n'Ah, but I didn't mean that. I mean in the open air--sport--that sort\\nof thing.'\\n\\n'Ah, you wish I go horseback riding. Ver' nice, but not for me. I have\\nnever did it. I cannot begun now, Lady Everard. I spoil all the\\n_veloute_ of my voice. Have you seen again that pretty little lady I\\nmet here before? Delicious light brown hair, pretty blue eyes, a\\nwonderful blue, a blue that seem to say to everyone something\\ndifferent.'\\n\\n'What!' exclaimed Lady Everard. 'Are you referring to Mrs Ottley?' She\\ncalmed down again. 'Oh yes, she's charming, awfully sweet--devoted to\\nher husband, you know--absolutely devoted to her husband; so rare and\\ndelightful nowadays in London.'\\n\\n'Oh yes, ver' nice. Me, I am devoted to 'er husband too. I go to see\\nhim. He ask me.'\\n\\n'What, without _me_?' exclaimed Lady Everard.\\n\\n'I meet him the other night. He ask me to come round and sing him a\\nsong. I cannot ask if I may bring Lady Everard in my pocket.'\\n\\n'Really, Paul, I don't think that quite a nice joke to make, I must\\nsay.' Then relenting she said: 'I know it's only your artistic fun.'\\n\\n'So she ver' devoted to him? He have great confidence in her; he trust\\nher quite; he sure she never have any flirt?'\\n\\n'He has every confidence; he's certain, absolutely certain!' exclaimed\\nLady Everard.\\n\\n'He wait till she come and tell him, I suppose. 'E is right.'\\n\\nHe continued in this strain for some time, constantly going back to his\\nadmiration for Edith, and then began (with a good deal of bitterness)\\non the subject of another young singer, whom he declared to be _un\\ngarcon charmant_, but no good. 'He could not sing for nuts.'\\n\\nShe heartily agreed, and they began to get on beautifully again, when\\nshe suddenly said to him:\\n\\n'Is it true you were seen talking in the park to that girl Miss\\nTurnbull, on Sunday?'\\n\\n'If you say I was seen, I was. You could not know I talk to her unless\\nI was seen. You could not know by wireless.'\\n\\n'Don't talk nonsense, Paul,' she answered sharply. 'The point isn't\\nthat you were seen, but that you did it.'\\n\\n'Who did it? Me? I didn't do anything.'\\n\\n'I don't think it's fair to me, I must say; it hurt my feelings that\\nyou should meet Amy Turnbull in the park and talk to her.'\\n\\n'But what could I say? It is ver' difficul. I walk through the park;\\nshe walk through it with another lady. She speak to me. She say: Ah,\\ndear Mr La France, what pleasure to see you! I ask you, Lady Everard,\\ncould I, a foreigner, not even naturalised here, could I order her out\\nof the park? Could I scream out to her: Go out, do not walk in ze Hyde\\nPark! Lady Everard do not like you! I have no authority to say that. I\\nam not responsible for the persons that walk in their own park in their\\nown country. She might answer me to go to the devil! She might say to\\nme: What, Lady Everard not like me, so I am not allowed in the park?\\nWhat that got to do with it? In a case like this, chere madame, I have\\nno legal power.'\\n\\nShe laughed forgivingly and said:\\n\\n'Ah, well, one mustn't be too exacting!' and as she showed some signs\\nof a desire to pat his hair he rose, sat down to the piano, greatly to\\nher disappointment, and filled up the rest of the time by improvising\\n(from memory). It was a little fatiguing, as she thought it her duty to\\nkeep up an expression of acute rapture during the whole of the\\nperformance, which lasted at least three-quarters of an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nMiss Bennett\\n\\nSince his return Aylmer saw everything through what he called a\\nrose-coloured microscope--that is to say, every detail of his life, and\\neverything connected with it, seemed to him perfect. He saw Edith as\\nmuch as ever, and far less formally than before. She treated him with\\naffectionate ease. She had admitted by her behaviour on the night he\\nreturned that she cared for him, and, for the moment, that was enough.\\nA sort of general relaxation of formality, due to the waning of the\\nseason, and to people being too busy to bother, or already in thought\\naway, seemed to give a greater freedom. Everyone seemed more natural,\\nand more satisfied to follow their own inclinations and let other\\npeople follow theirs. London was getting stale and tired, and the last\\nfeverish flickers of the exhausted season alternated with a kind of\\nlanguor in which nobody bothered much about anybody else's affairs.\\nGeneral interest was exhausted, and only a strong sense of\\nself-preservation seemed to be left; people clung desperately to their\\nlast hopes. Edith was curiously peaceful and contented. She would have\\nhad scarcely any leisure but that her mother-in-law sometimes relieved\\nher of the care of the children.\\n\\nBeing very anxious that they should not lose anything from Miss\\nTownsend's absence, she gave them lessons every day.\\n\\nOne day, at the end of a history lesson, Archie said:\\n\\n'Where's Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'She's at Bexhill.'\\n\\n'Why is she at Bexhill?'\\n\\n'Because she likes it.'\\n\\n'Where's Bexhill?'\\n\\n'In England.'\\n\\n'Why isn't Miss Townsend?'\\n\\n'What do you mean, Archie?'\\n\\n'Well, why isn't she Miss Townsend any more?'\\n\\n'She is.'\\n\\n'But she's not our Miss Townsend any more. Why isn't she?'\\n\\n'She's gone away.'\\n\\n'Isn't she coming back?'\\n\\n'No.'\\n\\nWatching his mother's face he realised that she didn't regret this, so\\nhe said:\\n\\n'Is Miss Townsend teaching anybody else?'\\n\\n'I daresay she is, or she will, perhaps.'\\n\\n'What are their names?'\\n\\n'How should I know?'\\n\\n'Do you think she'll teach anybody else called Archie?'\\n\\n'It's possible.'\\n\\n'I wonder if she'll ever be cross with the next boy she teaches.'\\n\\n'Miss Townsend was very kind to you,' said Edith. 'But you need not\\nthink about her any more, because you will be going to school when you\\ncome back from the holidays.'\\n\\n'That's what I told Dilly,' said Archie. 'But Dilly's not going to\\nschool. Dilly doesn't mind; she says she likes you better than Miss\\nTownsend.'\\n\\n'Very kind of her, I'm sure,' laughed Edith.\\n\\n'You see you're not a real governess,' said Archie, putting his arm\\nround her neck. 'You're not angry, are you, mother? Because you're not\\na real one it's more fun for us.'\\n\\n'How do you mean, I'm not a real governess?'\\n\\n'Well, I mean we're not _obliged_ to do what you tell us!'\\n\\n'Oh, aren't you? You've got to; you're to go now because I expect Miss\\nBennett.'\\n\\n'Can't I see Miss Bennett?'\\n\\n'Why do you want to see her?'\\n\\n'I don't want to see her; but she always brings parcels. I like to see\\nthe parcels.'\\n\\n'They are not for you; she brings parcels because I ask her to do\\nshopping for me. It's very kind of her.'\\n\\nShe waited a minute, then he said:\\n\\n'Mother, do let me be here when Miss Bennett brings the parcels. I'll\\nbe very useful. I can untie parcels with my teeth, like this. Look! I\\nthrow myself on the parcel just like a dog, and shake it and shake it,\\nand then I untie it with my teeth. It would be awfully useful.'\\n\\nShe refused the kind offer.\\n\\nMiss Bennett arrived as usual with the parcels, looking pleasantly\\nbusiness-like and important.\\n\\n'I wonder if these things will do?' she said, as she put them out on\\nthe table.\\n\\n'Oh, they're sure to do,' said Edith; 'they're perfect.'\\n\\n'My dear, wait till you see them. I don't think I've completed all your\\nlist.' She took out a piece of paper.\\n\\n'Where did you get everything?' Edith asked, without much interest.\\n\\n'At Boots', principally. Then the novels--Arnold Bennett, Maxwell--Oh,\\nand I've got you the poem: 'What is it?' by Gilbert Frankau.'\\n\\n'No, you mean, 'One of us',' corrected Edith.\\n\\n'Then white serge for nurse to make Dilly's skirts--skirts a quarter of\\na yard long!--how sweet!--and heaps and heaps of muslin, you see, for\\nher summer dresses. Won't she look an angel? Oh, and you told me to get\\nsome things to keep Archie quiet in the train.' She produced a drum, a\\ntrumpet, and a mechanical railway train. 'Will that do?'\\n\\n'Beautifully.'\\n\\n'And here's your travelling cloak from the other place.'\\n\\n'It looks lovely,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Aren't you going to try it on?'\\n\\n'No; it's sure to be all right.'\\n\\n'I never saw such a woman as you! Here are the hats. You've _got_ to\\nchoose these.'\\n\\nHere Edith showed more interest. She put them on, said all the colour\\nmust be taken out of them, white put in one, black velvet in the other.\\nOtherwise they would do.\\n\\n'Thanks, Grace; you're awfully kind and clever. Now do you know what\\nyou're going to do? You're going to the Academy with me and Aylmer.\\nHe's coming to fetch us.'\\n\\n'Oh, really--what fun!'\\n\\nAt this moment he arrived. Edith introduced them.\\n\\n'I've been having such a morning's shopping,' she said, 'I deserve a\\nlittle treat afterwards, don't I?'\\n\\n'What sort of shopping? I'll tell you what you ought to have--a great\\ncricket match when the shopping season's over, between the Old\\nSelfridgians, and the Old Harrodians,' he said, laughing.\\n\\nThey walked through acres of oil paintings and dozens of portraits of\\nChief Justices.\\n\\n'I can't imagine anyone but Royalty enjoying these pictures,' said\\nEdith.\\n\\n'They don't go to see pictures; they go to view exhibits,' Aylmer\\nanswered.\\n\\nDeclaring they had 'Academy headache' before they had been through the\\nsecond room, they sat down and watched the people.\\n\\nOne sees people there that are to be seen nowhere else. An\\nextraordinary large number of clergymen, a peculiar kind of provincial,\\nand strange Londoners, almost impossible to place, in surprising\\nclothes.\\n\\nThen they gave it up, and Aylmer took them out to lunch at a club\\nalmost as huge and noisy and as miscellaneous as the Academy itself.\\nHowever, they thoroughly enjoyed themselves.\\n\\nEdith and Bruce were to take up their abode in their little country\\nhouse at Westgate next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nAt Westgate\\n\\n'I've got to go up to town on special business,' said Bruce, one\\nafternoon, after receiving a telegram which he had rather\\nostentatiously left about, hoping he would be questioned on the\\nsubject. It had, however, been persistently disregarded.\\n\\n'Oh, have you?'\\n\\n'Yes. Look at this wire.'\\n\\nHe read aloud:\\n\\n'_Wish to see you at once if possible come up today M_.'\\n\\n'Who _is_ 'M'?'\\n\\n'Mitchell, of course. Who should it be?' He spoke aggressively, then\\nsoftened down to explanation, 'Mitchell's in town a few days on\\nbusiness, too. I may be detained till Tuesday--or even Wednesday next.'\\n\\nBruce had been to town so often lately, his manner was so vague, he\\nseemed at once so happy and so preoccupied, so excited, so pleased, so\\nworried, and yet so unnaturally good-tempered, that Edith had begun to\\nsuspect he was seeing Miss Townsend again.\\n\\nThe suspicion hurt her, for he had given his word of honour, and had\\nbeen nice to her ever since, and amiable (though rather absent and\\nbored) with the children.\\n\\nShe walked down to the station with him, though he wished to go in the\\ncab which took his box and suit-case, but he did not resist her wish.\\nOn the way he said, looking round as if he had only just arrived and\\nhad never seen it before:\\n\\n'This is a very nice little place. It's just the right place for you\\nand the children. If I were you, I should stay on here.'\\n\\nIt struck her he spoke in a very detached way, and some odd\\nforeshadowing came to her.\\n\\n'Why--aren't you coming back?' she asked jokingly.\\n\\n'Me? _What_ an idea! Yes, of course. But I've told you--this\\nbusiness of mine--well, it'll take a little time to arrange. Still, I\\nexpect to be back on Tuesday. Or quite on Wednesday--or sooner.'\\n\\nThey walked on and had nearly reached the station.\\n\\n'How funny you are, Bruce!'\\n\\n'What do you mean? Are you angry with me for going up to see about\\nimportant business? Why, here you've got Aylmer and his boy at the\\nhotel, my mother and Vincy to stay with you. You've got plenty of\\ncompanions. I don't suppose you'll miss me much. You see--a--this is a\\nsort of business matter women don't understand. Women are incapable of\\nunderstanding it.'\\n\\n'Of what nature is it?'\\n\\n'How do you mean, nature? It's not of any particular _nature_. Nature,\\nindeed! How like a woman! It's just business.' He waited a minute.\\n'Stockbroking; that's what it is. Yes, it's stockbroking. I want to see\\na chap who's put me in to a good thing. A perfectly safe thing. No\\ngambling. But one has to see into it, you see. Mitchell wants to see me\\nat once, you see. Do you see? You saw his wire, didn't you? I've\\nexplained, haven't I? Aren't you satisfied with my explanation?'\\n\\n'_You_ appear to be--very. But I'm not asking you to tell me any\\ndetails about the business, whatever it may be.'\\n\\nThey arrived at the station, and Bruce gave her what she thought a very\\nqueer look. It was a mixture of fear, daring, caution and a sort of\\nbravado. Anxiety was in it, as well as a pleased self-consciousness.\\n\\n'Tell me, frankly, something I'd like to know, Bruce.'\\n\\n'Are you getting suspicious of me, Edith? That's not like you. Mind\\nyou, it's a great mistake in a woman; women should always trust.\\nMistrust sometimes drives a man to--to--Oh, anyhow, it's a great\\nmistake.'\\n\\n'I only want you to tell me something, Bruce. I'll believe you\\nimplicitly if you'll answer.... Do you ever see Miss Townsend now?'\\n\\n'Never, on my honour! I swear it.' He spoke with such genuine good\\nfaith that she believed him at once.\\n\\n'Thanks. I'm glad. And--have you never since--'\\n\\n'Never seen her, never written to her, never communicated with her\\nsince she left! Don't know where she is and don't care. Now you do\\nbelieve me?' he asked, with all the earnestness and energy of truth.\\n\\n'Absolutely. Forgive me for asking.'\\n\\n'Oh, that's all right.'\\n\\nHe was relieved, and smiled.\\n\\n'All right, Bruce dear. I'm glad. It would have worried me.'\\n\\n'Now go, Edith. Don't bother to wait till I get in. I'll write to\\nyou--I'll write to you soon.'\\n\\nShe still lingered, seeing something odd in his manner.\\n\\n'Give my love to my mother,' he said, looking away. 'I say--' Edith.'\\n\\n'Yes, dear?'\\n\\n'Oh, nothing.'\\n\\nShe waited on till the train started. His manner was alternately\\npeevish and kind, but altogether odd. Her last glimpse was a rather\\npale smile from Bruce as he waved his hand and then turned to his\\npaper....\\n\\n'Well, what _does_ it matter so long as he _has_ gone!' exclaimed\\nAylmer impatiently, when she expressed her wonder at Bruce's going. The\\ntide was low, and they went for a long walk over the hard shining sand,\\nfollowed by Archie picking up wonderful shells and slipping on the\\ngreen seaweed. Everything seemed fresh, lovely. She herself was as\\nfresh as the sea breeze, and Aylmer seemed to her as strong as the sea.\\n(Privately, Edith thought him irresistible in country clothes.) Edith\\nhad everything here to make her happy, including Bruce's mother, who\\nrelieved her of the children when she wanted rest and in whose eyes she\\nwas perfection.\\n\\nShe saw restrained adoration in Aylmer's eyes, love and trust in the\\neyes of the children. She had all she wanted. And yet--something tugged\\nat her heart, and worried her. She had a strange and melancholy\\npresentiment.\\n\\nBut she threw it off. Probably there was nothing really wrong with\\nBruce; perhaps only one of those little imaginary romances that he\\nliked to fabricate for himself; or, perhaps, it was really business? It\\nwas all right if Mr Mitchell knew about it. Yet she could not believe\\nthat 'M' _was_ Mitchell. Bruce had repeated it too often; and, why on\\nearth should Mitchell suddenly take to sending Bruce fantastic\\ntelegrams and signing them, for no reason, with an initial?...\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\nGoggles\\n\\n'What divine heavenly pets and ducks of angels they are!' exclaimed\\nLady Everard rather distractedly. 'Angels! Divine! And so good, too! I\\nnever saw such darlings in my life. Look at them, Paul. Aren't they\\nsweet?'\\n\\nLady Everard with her party (what Aylmer called her performing troupe)\\nhad driven over to Westgate, from where she was staying in the\\nneighbourhood, to have tea with Edith. She had brought with her a sort\\nof juvenile party, consisting of Mr Cricker, Captain Willis and, of\\ncourse, Paul La France, the young singer. She never moved without him.\\nShe explained that two other women had been coming also, but they had\\ndeserted her at the last minute.\\n\\nPaul La France had been trying for an hour and a half to make eyes\\nthrough motor goggles, which, naturally, was not a success; so he\\nseemed a little out of temper. Archie was staring at him as if\\nfascinated. He went up and said:\\n\\n'Voulez-vous lend me your goggles?'\\n\\n'Mais certainement! Of course I will. Voila mon petit.'\\n\\n'The darling! How sweet and amusing of him! But they're only to be used\\nin the motor, you know. Don't break them, darling, will you? Monsieur\\nwill want them again. Ah! how sweet he looks!' as he put them on, 'I\\nnever saw such a darling in the whole course of my life! Look at him,\\nMrs Ottley. Look at him, Paul!'\\n\\n'Charmant. C'est delicieux,' grumbled La France.\\n\\n'What a charming little lawn this is, going right down to the sea, too.\\nOh, Mr Ross, is that you? Isn't this a delightful little house? More\\ntea? Yes, please. Mr La France doesn't take sugar, and--'\\n\\n'You don't know what I am now,' said Archie, having fixed the goggles\\non his own fair head, to the delight of Dilly.\\n\\n'Oh, I guess what you are! You're a motorist, aren't you, darling?\\nThat's it! It's extraordinary how well I always get on with children,\\nMrs Ottley,' explained Lady Everard. 'I daresay it's through being used\\nto my little grandchildren, Eva's two angels, you know, but I never see\\nthem because I can't stand their noise, and yet I simply adore them.\\nPets!'\\n\\n'What am I?' asked Archie, in his persistent way, as he walked round\\nthe group on the lawn, in goggles, followed closely by Dilly, saying,\\n'Yes, what is he?' looking exactly like a live doll, with her golden\\nhair and blue ribbons.\\n\\n'You're a motorist, darling.'\\n\\n'No, I'm not a silly motorist. Guess what I am?'\\n\\n'It's so difficult to guess, such hot weather! Can you guess, Paul?'\\n\\n'I sink he is a nuisance,' replied the Frenchman, laughing politely.\\n\\n'No, that's wrong. You guess what I am.'\\n\\n'Guess what he is,' echoed Dilly.\\n\\n'O Lord! what does it matter? What I always say is--live and let live,\\nand let it go at that,' said Captain Willis, with his loud laugh.\\n'What, Mrs Ottley? But they won't do it, you know--they won't--and\\nthere it is!'\\n\\n'Guess what I am,' persisted Archie.\\n\\n'Never mind what you are; do go and sit down, and take those things\\noff,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Not till you guess what I am.'\\n\\n'Does Dilly know?'\\n\\n'No, Dilly doesn't know. Guess what I am, grandmamma!'\\n\\n'I give it up.'\\n\\n'I thought you'd never guess. Well, I'm a blue-faced mandrill!'\\ndeclared Archie, as he took the goggles off reluctantly and gave them\\nback to La France, who put them under his chair.\\n\\n'Yes, he's a two-faced mangle,' repeated Dilly.\\n\\nHe turned round on her sharply. 'Now, don't talk nonsense! You're a\\nsilly girl. I never said anything about being a two-faced mangle; I'm\\na blue-faced mandrill.'\\n\\n'Well, I said so; a two-faced mangle.'\\n\\n'Don't say anything at all if you can't say it right,' said Archie,\\nraising his voice and losing his temper.\\n\\n'Well, they's both the same.'\\n\\n'No, they jolly well aren't.'\\n\\nHe drew her a little aside. 'A blue-faced mandrill, silly, is real;\\nit's in my natural history book.'\\n\\n'Sorry,' said Dilly apologetically.\\n\\n'In my natural history book it is, a _real_ thing. I'm a blue-faced\\nmandrill.... Now say it after me.'\\n\\n'You's a two-faced mangle.'\\n\\n'Now you're doing it on purpose! If you weren't a little girl, Dilly--'\\n\\n'I wasn't doing it on purpose.'\\n\\n'Oh, get away before I hit you! You're a silly little fool.'\\n\\nShe slowly walked away, calling out: 'And you're a silly two-faced\\nmangle,' in a very irritating tone. Archie made a tremendous effort to\\nignore her, then he ran after her saying:\\n\\n'Will you shut up or will you not?'\\n\\nAylmer seized hold of him.\\n\\n'What are you going to do, Archie?'\\n\\n'Teach Dilly what I am. She says--Oh, she's _such_ a fool!'\\n\\n'No, Archie, leave her alone; she's only a baby. Come along, old boy.\\nGive Mr Cricker a cup of tea; he hasn't had one yet.'\\n\\nArchie was devoted to Aylmer. Following him, he handed the tea to Mr\\nCricker, saying pathetically:\\n\\n'I'm a blue-faced mandrill, and she knew it. I told her so. Aren't\\ngirls fools? They do worry!'\\n\\n'They _are_ torments,' said Aylmer.\\n\\n'I wish that Frenchman would give me his goggles to keep! He doesn't\\nwant them.'\\n\\n'I'll give you a pair,' said Aylmer.\\n\\n'Thanks,' said Cricker,' I won't have any tea. I wish you'd come and\\nhave a little talk with me, Ross. Can I have a word with you alone?'\\n\\nAylmer good-naturedly went aside with him.\\n\\n'It's worse than ever,' said Cricker, in low, mysterious tones. 'Since\\nI've been staying with Lady Everard it's been wire, wire, wire--ring,\\nring, ring--and letters by every post! You see, I thought it was rather\\na good plan to get away for a bit, but I'm afraid I shall have to go\\nback. Fancy, she's threatened suicide, and telling her husband, and\\nconfiding in Lady Everard! And giving up the stage, and oh, goodness\\nknows what! There's no doubt the poor child is absolutely raving about\\nme. No doubt whatever.'\\n\\nAylmer was as sympathetic as he knew how.\\n\\nThe party was just going off when La France found that the\\ngoggles had disappeared. A search-party was organised; great excitement\\nprevailed; but in the end they went away without the glasses.\\n\\nWhen Dilly had just gone to sleep in her cot a frightening figure crept\\ninto her room and turned on the electric light.\\n\\n'Oh, Archie! What is it! Who is it! Oh!... Oh!'\\n\\n'Don't be frightened,' said Archie, in his deepest voice, obviously\\nhoping she would be frightened. He was in pyjamas and goggles. 'Don't\\nbe frightened! _Now! Say what I am_. What am I?'\\n\\n'A blue-faced mandrill,' she whined.\\n\\nHe took off the goggles and kissed her.\\n\\n'Right! Good night, old girl!'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\nThe Elopement\\n\\nThe following Tuesday, Edith, Aylmer, Vincy and Mrs Ottley were sitting\\non the veranda after dinner. They had a charming little veranda which\\nled on to a lawn, and from there straight down to the sea. It was their\\ncustom to sit there in the evening and talk. The elder Mrs Ottley\\nenjoyed these evenings, and the most modern conversation never seemed\\nto startle her. She would listen impassively, or with a smile, as if in\\nsilent approval, to the most monstrous of paradoxes or the most\\nchildish chaff.\\n\\nAylmer's attention and kind thought for her had absolutely won her\\nheart. She consulted him about everything, and was only thoroughly\\nsatisfied when he was there. His strong, kind, decided voice, his good\\nlooks, his decision, and a sort of responsible impulsiveness, all\\nappealed to her immensely. She looked up to him, in a kind of admiring\\nmaternal way; Edith often wondered, did she not see Aylmer's devotion?\\nBut, if she did, Mrs Ottley thought nothing of it. Her opinion of Edith\\nwas so high that she trusted her in any complications....\\n\\n'Isn't Bruce coming down tonight?' she asked Edith.\\n\\n'I'm to have a wire.'\\n\\n'Ah, here's the last post. Perhaps he's written instead.'\\n\\nVincy fetched the letters. There was one from Bruce.\\n\\nEdith went into the drawing-room to read it; there was not sufficient\\nlight on the veranda....\\n\\nIn growing amazement she read the following words:--\\n\\nDEAR EDITH,\\n\\n'I hope what I am about to tell you will not worry you too much. At any\\nrate I do hope you will not allow it to affect your health. It is\\ninevitable, and you must make up your mind to it as soon as possible. I\\nsay this in no spirit of unkindness; far from it. It is hard to me to\\nbreak the news to you, but it must be done.\\n\\n'Mavis Argles and I are all in all to each other. We have made up our\\nminds on account of certain _circumstances_ to throw in our lot\\ntogether, and we are starting for Australia today. When this reaches\\nyou, we shall have started. I enclose the address to write to me.\\n\\n'In taking this step I have, I am sure, acted for the best. It may\\ncause you great surprise and pain. I regret it, but we met and became\\nvery quickly devoted to one another. She cannot live without me. What I\\nam doing is my duty. I now ask you, and believe you will grant my\\nrequest, to make arrangements to _give me my freedom as soon as\\npossible_. Mind you do this, Edith, for it is really my duty to give my\\nname to Mavis, who, as I have said, is devoted to me heart and soul,\\nand cannot live without me.\\n\\n'I shall always have the greatest regard and respect for you, and _wish\\nyou well_.\\n\\n'I am sorry also about my mother, but you must try and explain that it\\nis for the best. You also will know exactly what to do, and how to\\nbring up the children just as well without me as with.\\n\\n'Hoping this sudden news will not affect your health in any way, and\\nthat you will try and stay on a good while at Westgate, as I am sure\\nthe air is doing you good, believe me, yours affectionately as always,\\n\\n'BRUCE.\\n\\n'_P.S._--Mind you don't forget to divorce me as soon as you can for\\nMavis's sake. Vincy will give you all the advice you need. Don't think\\nbadly of me; I have meant well. Try and cheer up. I am sorry not to\\nwrite more fully, but you can imagine how I was rushed to catch today's\\nsteamer.'\\n\\nShe sat alone gazing at the letter under the light. She was divided at\\nfirst between a desire to laugh and cry. Bruce had actually eloped! His\\nsilly weakness had culminated, his vanity had been got hold of. Vincy's\\nhorrid little art-student had positively led him into running away,\\nand leaving his wife and children.\\n\\nControlling herself, Edith went to the veranda and said to Mrs Ottley\\nthat Bruce wasn't coming back for a day or two, that she had neuralgia\\nand was going to retire, but begged Aylmer not to go yet. Of course at\\nthis he went at once.\\n\\nThe next morning Aylmer at his hotel received a little note asking him\\nto come round and see Edith, while the others were out.\\n\\nIt was there, in the cool, shady room, that Edith showed him the\\nletter.\\n\\n'Good God!' he exclaimed, looking simply wild with joy. 'This is too\\nmarvellous!--too heavenly! Do you realise it? Edith, don't you see he\\nwants you to make him free? You will be my wife--that's\\nsettled--that's fixed up.'\\n\\nHe looked at her in delight almost too great for expression.\\n\\nEdith knew she was going to have a hard task now. She was pale, but\\nlooked completely composed. She said:\\n\\n'You're wrong, Aylmer. I'm not going to set him free.'\\n\\n'What?' he almost shouted. 'Are you mad? What! Stick to him when he\\ndoesn't want you! Ruin the wretched girl's life!'\\n\\n'That remains to be seen. I don't believe everything in the letter. The\\nchildren--'\\n\\n'Edith!' he exclaimed. 'What--when he doesn't _want_ the children--when\\nhe deserts them?'\\n\\n'He is their father.'\\n\\n'Their father! Then, if you were married to a criminal who implored you\\nto divorce him you wouldn't, because he was their father!'\\n\\n'Bruce is not a criminal. He is not bad. He is a fool. He has behaved\\nidiotically, and I can never care for him in the way I used to, but I\\nmean to give him a chance. I'm not going to jump at his first real\\nfolly to get rid of him.... Poor Bruce!'\\n\\nShe laughed.\\n\\nAylmer threw himself down in an arm-chair, staring at her.\\n\\n'You amaze me,' he said. 'You amaze me. You're not human. Do you adore\\nthis man, that you forgive him everything? You don't even seem angry.'\\n\\n'I don't adore him, that is why I'm not so very angry. I was terribly\\nhurt about Miss Townsend. My pride, my trust were hurt but after that I\\ncan't ever feel that personal jealousy any more. What I have got to\\nthink of is what is best.'\\n\\n'Edith, you don't care for me. I'd better go away.' He turned away; he\\nhad tears in his eyes.\\n\\n'Oh, don't, Aylmer! You know I do!'\\n\\n'Well, then, it's all right. Fate seems to have arranged this on\\npurpose for us--don't you know, dear, how I'd be good to the children?\\nHow I'd do anything on this earth for them? Why, I'd reconcile Mrs\\nOttley to it in ten minutes; I'd do _anything_!' He started up.\\n\\n'I'm not going to let Mrs Ottley know anything about it for the\\npresent.'\\n\\n'You're not going to tell her?'\\n\\n'No. I shall invent a story to account for his absence. No-one need\\nknow. But, of course, if, later--I mean if he persists--'\\n\\n'Oh, Edith, don't be a fool! You're throwing away our happiness when\\nyou've got it in your hand.'\\n\\n'There are some things that one _can't_ do.' said Edith. 'It goes\\nagainst the grain. I can't take advantage of his folly to make the path\\nsmoother--for myself. What will become of him when they quarrel! It's\\nall nonsense. Bruce is only weak. He's a very good fellow, really. He\\nhas no spirit, and not much intellect; but with us to look after him,'\\nshe unconsciously said us, and could not help smiling at the absurdity\\nof it,' he will get along all right yet.'\\n\\n'Edith, you're beyond me,' said Aylmer. 'I give up understanding you.'\\n\\nShe stood up again and looked out of the window.\\n\\n'Let him have his silly holiday and his elopement and his trip! He\\nthinks it will make a terrific sensation! And I hope she will be\\nseasick. I'm sure she will; she's the sort of woman who would, and\\nthen--after--'\\n\\n'And you'll take him back? You have no pride, Edith.'\\n\\nShe turned round. 'Take him back?--yes; officially. He has a right to\\nlive in his own house, with his own children. Why, ever since I found\\nout about Miss Townsend ... I'm sure I was nice to him, but only like a\\nsister. Yes. I feel just like a sister to him now.'\\n\\n'Oh, good God! I haven't patience with all this hair-splitting\\nnonsense. Brotherly husbands who run away with other girls, and beg you\\nto divorce them; sisterly wives who forgive them and stick to them\\nagainst their will....'\\n\\nHe suddenly stopped, and held out his hand.\\n\\n'Forgive me, Edith. I believe whatever you say is right. Will you\\nforgive me?'\\n\\n'You see, it's chiefly on account of the children. If it weren't for\\nthem I _would_ take advantage of this to be happy with you. At\\nleast--no--I'm not sure that I would; not if I thought it would be\\nBruce's ruin.'\\n\\n'And you don't think I'd be good to the children?'\\n\\n'Good? I know you would be an angel to them! But what's the use? I tell\\nyou I can't do it.'\\n\\n'I won't tease you, I won't worry you any more,' he said, in a rather\\nbroken voice. 'At any rate, think what a terrible blow this is to me.\\nYou show me the chance of heaven, then you voluntarily dash it away.\\nDon't you think you ought to consult someone? You have asked no-one?'\\n\\n'I have consulted _you_,' she said, with a slight smile.\\n\\n'You take no notice of what I say.'\\n\\n'As a matter of fact, I don't wish to consult anyone. I have made my\\nown decision. I have written my letter.'\\n\\nShe took it out of her bag. It was directed to Bruce, at the address he\\nhad given her in Australia.\\n\\n'I suppose you won't let me read it?' he said sadly.\\n\\n'I think I'd rather not,' she said.\\n\\nTerribly hurt, he turned to the door.\\n\\n'No--no, you shall read it!' she exclaimed. 'But don't say anything,\\nmake no remark about it. You shall read it because I trust you, because\\nI really care for you.'\\n\\n'Perhaps I oughtn't to,' he said. 'No, dear; keep it to yourself.' His\\ndelicacy had revived and he was ashamed of his jealousy.\\n\\nBut now she insisted on showing it to him, and he read:\\n\\n'DEAR BRUCE,\\n\\n'I'm not going to make any appeal to your feelings with regard to your\\nmother and the children, because if you had thought even of me a little\\nthis would not have happened. I'm very, very sorry for it. I believe it\\nhappened from your weakness and foolishness, or you could not have\\nbehaved with such irresponsibility, but I'm trying to look at it quite\\ncalmly. I therefore propose to do nothing at all for three months. If I\\nacted on your suggestion you might regret it ever after. If in three\\nmonths you write to me again in the same strain, still desiring to be\\nfree, I will think of it, though I'm not sure that I should do it even\\nthen. But in case you change your mind I propose to tell nobody, not\\neven your mother. By the time you get this letter, it will be six weeks\\nsince yours to me, and you may look at things differently. Perhaps by\\nthen you will be glad to hear that I have told your mother merely that\\nyou have been ordered away for a change, and I shall say the same to\\nanyone else who inquires for you. If you feel after this time still\\nresponsible, and that you have a certain duty, still remember, even so,\\nyou might be very unhappy together all your lives. Excuse me, then, if\\nI don't take you at your word.\\n\\n'Another point occurs to me. In your hurry and excitement, perhaps you\\nforgot that your father's legacy depended on the condition that you\\nshould not leave the Foreign Office before you were fifty. That is\\nabout fourteen years from now. If you are legally freed, and marry Miss\\nArgles, you could hardly go back there. I think it would be practically\\nimpossible under those circumstances, while if you live in Australia\\nyou will have hardly any means. I merely remind you of this, in case\\nyou had forgotten.\\n\\n'I shall regard it all as an unfortunate aberration; and if you regret\\nit, and change your mind, you will be free at any time you like to come\\nback and nothing shall be ever said about it. But I'm not begging you\\nto do so. I may be wrong; perhaps she's the woman to make you happy.\\nLet me know within three months how you feel about it. No-one will\\nsuffer except myself during this time, as I shall keep it from your\\nmother, and shall remain here during this time. Perhaps you will be\\nvery angry with me that I don't wish to take you at your word, Bruce.\\nAt first I thought I would, but I'm doing what I think right, and one\\ncannot do more.\\n\\n'I'm not going to reproach you, for if you don't feel the claims of\\nothers on you, my words will make no difference.\\n\\n'Think over what I say. Should you be unhappy and wish to separate from\\nher without knowing how, and if it becomes a question of money, as so\\nmany things do, I would help you. I did not remind you about your\\nfather's legacy to induce you to come back. If you really find\\nhappiness in the way you expect, we could arrange it. You see, I have\\nthought of everything, in one night. But you _won't_ be happy.\\n\\n'EDITH OTTLEY.'\\n\\n'Remember, whenever you like to come back, you will be welcomed, and\\nnothing shall ever be said about it.'\\n\\nAylmer gave her back the letter. He was touched.\\n\\n'You see,' she said eagerly, 'I haven't got a grain of jealousy. All\\nthat part is quite finished. That's the very reason why I can judge\\ncalmly.'\\n\\nShe fastened up the letter, and then said with a smile:\\n\\n'And now, let's be happy the rest of the summer. Won't you?'\\n\\nHe answered that she was _impayable_--marvellous--that he would help\\nher--devote himself to doing whatever she wished. On consideration he\\nsaw that there was still hope.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\n\\nBruce Returns\\n\\n'Never, Edith!' exclaimed Vincy, fixing his eyeglass in his eye, and\\nopening his mouth in astonishment. 'Never! Well, I'm gormed!'\\n\\nA week had passed since the news of Bruce's elopement. The little group\\nat Westgate didn't seem to have much been affected by it; and this was\\nthe less surprising as Aylmer and Edith had kept it to themselves. Mrs\\nOttley listened imperturbably to Edith's story, a somewhat incoherent\\nconcoction, but told with dash and decision, that Bruce had been\\nordered away for a sea-voyage for fear of a nervous breakdown. She\\ncried a little, said nothing, kissed Edith more than usual, and took\\nthe children away for longer walks and drives. With a mother's\\nflashlight of intuition she felt at once certain there was something\\nwrong, but she didn't wish to probe the subject. Her confidence in\\nEdith reached the point of superstition; she would never ask her\\nquestions. Edith had assured her that Bruce would come back all right,\\nand that was enough. Personally, Mrs Ottley much preferred the society\\nof Aylmer to that of her son. Aylmer was far more amusing, far more\\nconsiderate to her, and to everybody else, and he didn't use his\\nnatural charm for those who amused him only, as the ordinary\\nfascinating man does. Probably there was at the back of his attentions\\nto Mrs Ottley a vague idea that he wanted to get her on his side--that\\nshe might be a useful ally; but he was always charming to elderly\\nwomen, and inclined to be brusque with younger ones, excepting Edith;\\nhe remembered his own mother with so great a cult of devotion, and his\\nlate wife with such a depressed indifference.\\n\\nEdith had asked Aylmer to try and forget what had happened--to make\\nhimself believe that Bruce had really only gone away medicinally. For\\nthe present, he did as she wished, but he was longing to begin talking\\nto her on the subject again, both because it interested him\\npassionately from the psychological point of view, and far more,\\nnaturally, because he had hopes of persuading her in time. She was not\\nbound by letter; she could change her mind. Bruce might and possibly\\nwould, insist.\\n\\nThere was difficulty in keeping the secret from Vincy, who was actually\\nstaying in the house, and whose wonderful nerves and whimsical mind\\nwere so sensitive to every variation of his surroundings. He had the\\ngift of reading people's minds. But it never annoyed anyone; one felt\\nhe had no illusions; that he sympathised with one's weaknesses and\\nfollies and, in a sense, enjoyed them, from a literary point of view.\\nProbably his friends forgave his clear vision for the sake of his\\ninterest. Most people would far rather be seen through than not be seen\\nat all.\\n\\nOne day Vincy, alone on the beach with Edith, remarked that he wondered\\nwhat had happened to Mavis.\\n\\nEdith told him that she had run away with a married man.\\n\\n'Never, Edith!' he exclaimed. 'Who would have thought it! It seems\\nalmost too good to be true!'\\n\\n'Don't say that, Vincy.'\\n\\n'But how did you hear it? You know everything.'\\n\\n'I heard it on good authority. I _know_ it's true.'\\n\\n'And to think I was passing the remark only the other day that I\\nthought I ought to look her up, in a manner of speaking, or write, _or\\nsomething_,' continued Vincy; 'and who _is_ the poor dear man? Do you\\nknow?'\\n\\nHe looked at her with a sudden vague suspicion of he knew not what.\\n\\n'Bruce was always inclined to be romantic, you know,' she said\\nsteadily.\\n\\n'Oh, give over!'\\n\\n'Yes, that's it; I didn't want anyone to know about it. I'm so afraid\\nof making Mrs Ottley unhappy.'\\n\\n'But you're not serious, Edith?'\\n\\n'I suppose I'd better show you his letter. He tells me to ask your\\nadvice.'\\n\\nShe gave it to him.\\n\\n'There is only one word for what I feel about it,' Vincy said, as he\\ngave it back. 'I'm gormed! Simply gormed! Gormed, Edith dear, is really\\nthe only word.'\\n\\n'I'm not jealous,' said Edith. 'My last trouble with Bruce seems to\\nhave cured me of any feeling of the kind. But I have a sort of pity and\\naffection for him still in a way--almost like a mother! I'm really\\nafraid he will be miserable with her, and then he'll feel tied to her\\nand be wretched all his life. So I'm giving him a chance.'\\n\\nHe looked at her with admiring sympathy.\\n\\n'But what about other friends?'\\n\\n'Well--oh, you know--'\\n\\n'Edith, I'm awfully sorry; I wish I'd married her now, then she\\nwouldn't have bothered about Bruce.'\\n\\n'But you can't stand her, Vincy.'\\n\\n'I know, Edith dear; but I'd marry any number of people to prevent\\nanything tiresome for you. And Aylmer, of course--Edith, really, I\\nthink Aylmer ought to go away; I'm sure he ought. It is a mistake to\\nlet him stay here under these circumstances.'\\n\\n'Why?' said Edith. 'I don't see that; if I were going to take Bruce at\\nhis word, then it would be different, of course.'\\n\\n'It does seem a pity not to, in some ways; everything would be all\\nnicely settled up, just like the fourth act of a play. And then I\\nshould be glad I hadn't married Mavis... Oh, do let it be like the\\nfourth act, Edith.'\\n\\n'How can life be like a play? It's hopeless to attempt it,' she said\\nrather sadly.\\n\\n'Edith, do you think if Bruce knew--how much you liked Aylmer--he would\\nhave written that letter?'\\n\\n'No. And I don't believe he would ever have gone away.'\\n\\n'Still, I think you ought to send Aylmer away now.'\\n\\n'Why?' she repeated. 'Nothing could be more intensely correct. Mrs\\nOttley's staying with me--why shouldn't I have the pleasure of seeing\\nAylmer because Bruce is having a heavenly time on board ship?'\\n\\n'I suppose there's that point of view,' said Vincy, rather bewildered.\\n'I say, Edith!'\\n\\n'About Bruce having a heavenly time on board ship--a--she always\\ngrumbles; she's always complaining. She's never, never satisfied... She\\nkeeps on making scenes.'\\n\\n'So does Bruce.'\\n\\n'Yes. But I suppose if there's a certain predicament--then--Oh,\\nEdith--are you unhappy?'\\n\\n'No, not a bit now. I think I'm only really unhappy when I'm undecided.\\nOnce I've taken a line--no matter what it is--I can be happy again. I\\ncan adjust myself to my good fortune.'\\n\\nCuriously, when Edith had once got over the pain and shock that the\\nletter first gave her, she was positively happier now than she ever had\\nbeen before. Bruce really must have been a more formidable bore than\\nshe had known, since his absence left such a delicious freedom. The\\ncertainty of having done the right, the wisest thing, was a support, a\\nproud satisfaction.\\n\\nDuring these summer days Aylmer was not so peacefully happy. His\\ndevotion was assiduous, silent, discreet, and sometimes his feelings\\nwere almost uncontrollable, but he hoped; and he consoled himself by\\nthe thought that some day he would really have his wish--anything might\\nhappen; the chances were all in his favour.\\n\\nWhat an extraordinary woman she was--and how pretty--how subtle; how\\nperfect their life might be together....\\n\\nHe implored Vincy to use his influence.\\n\\n'I can't see Edith in anything so crude as the--as--that court,' Vincy\\nsaid.\\n\\n'But Bruce begs her to do it. What could their life be together\\nafterwards? It's simply a deliberate sacrifice.'\\n\\n'There's every hope that Miss Argles will never let him go,' said\\nVincy. 'One has to be very firm to get away from her. Oh, ever so firm,\\nand _obstinate_, you can't think! How many times a day she must be\\nreproaching Bruce--that will be rather a change for him. However,\\nanything may happen,' said Vincy soothingly. He still maintained, for\\nhe had a very strong sense of propriety in matters of form, that Aylmer\\nought to go away. But Edith would not agree.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSo the children played and enjoyed themselves, and sometimes asked\\nafter their father, and Mrs Ottley, though a little anxious, enjoyed\\nherself too, and Edith had never been so happy. She was having a\\nholiday. She dismissed all trouble and lived in a sort of dream.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTowards the end of the summer, hearing no more from Bruce, Aylmer grew\\nstill more hopeful; he began to regard it as practically settled. The\\nnext letter in answer to Edith's would doubtless convince her, and he\\nwould then persuade her; it was, tacitly, he thought, almost agreed\\nnow; it was not spoken of between them, but he believed it was all\\nright....\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAylmer had come back to London in the early days of September and was\\nwandering through his house thinking how he would have it done up and\\nhow he wouldn't leave it when they were married, when a telephone\\nmessage summoned him to Knightsbridge.\\n\\nHe went, and found the elder Mrs Ottley just going away. He thought she\\nlooked at him rather strangely.\\n\\n'I think Edith wants to speak to you,' she said, as she left the room.\\n'Dear Edith! Be nice to her.' And she fled.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAylmer waited alone, looking round the room that he loved because he\\nassociated it with her.\\n\\nIt was one of the first cold damp days of the autumn, and there was a\\nfire. Edith came in, in a dark dress, looking pale, and different, he\\nthought. She had seemed the very spirit of summer only a day or two\\nbefore.\\n\\nA chill presentiment struck to his heart.\\n\\n'You've had a letter? Go on; don't keep me in suspense.' He spoke with\\nnervous impatience, and no self-restraint.\\n\\nShe sat down by him. She had no wish to create an effect, but she found\\nit difficult to speak.\\n\\n'Yes, I've had a letter,' she said quietly. 'They've quarrelled. They\\nquarrelled on board. He hates her. He says he would rather die than\\nremain with her. He's written me a rather nice letter. They quarrelled\\nso frightfully that a young man on board interfered,' she said, smiling\\nfaintly. 'As soon as they arrived the young man married her. He's a\\ncommercial traveller. He's only twenty-five.... It seems he pitied her\\nso much that he proposed to her on board, and she left Bruce. It wasn't\\ntrue about the predicament. It was--a mistake. Bruce was grateful for\\nmy letter. He's glad I've not told anyone--not done anything. Now the\\nchildren will never know. But I've told Mrs Ottley all about it. I\\nthought I'd better, now it's over. She won't ask him questions....\\nBruce is on his way home.'\\n\\n'All right!' said Aylmer, getting up. 'Let him come. Forgive him again,\\nthat's right! Would you have done that for _me_?'\\n\\n'No! Never! If you had once been unfaithful, and I knew it, I'd never\\nhave forgiven you.'\\n\\n'I quite believe it. But why?'\\n\\n'Because I care for you too much. If you had been in Bruce's position I\\nshould never have seen you again. With him it's different. It's a\\nfeeling of--it's for him, not for me. I've felt no jealousy, no\\npassion, so I could judge calmly.'\\n\\n'All right,' repeated Aylmer ironically; 'all right! Judge calmly! Do\\nthe right thing. You know best.' He stopped a moment, and then said,\\ntaking his hat: 'I understand now. I see clearly at last. You've had\\nthe opportunity and you wouldn't take it; you don't care for me. I'm\\ngoing.'\\n\\nHe went to the door.\\n\\n'Oh, come back, Aylmer! Don't go like that! You know I care for you,\\nbut what could I do? I foresaw this...You know, I can't feel _no_\\nresponsibility about Bruce. I couldn't make my happiness out of someone\\nelse's misery. He would have been miserable and, not only that, it\\nwould have been his ruin. Bruce could never be safe, happy, or all\\nright, except here.'\\n\\n'And you think he'll alter, now, be grateful and devoted, I\\nsuppose--appreciate you?'\\n\\n'Do people alter?' she answered.\\n\\n'I neither know nor care if he will, but you? I could have made you\\nhappy. You won't let me. Oh, Edith, how could you torture me like this\\nall the summer?'\\n\\n'I didn't mean to torture you. We enjoyed being together.'\\n\\n'Yes. But it makes this so much harder.'\\n\\n'It would be such a risk!' she answered. 'But is anything worth having\\nunless you're ready to risk every-thing to get it?'\\n\\n'I _would_ risk everything, for myself. But not for others...If you\\nfeel you want to go away,' she said, 'let it be only for a little\\nwhile.'\\n\\n'A little while! I hope I shall _never_ see you again! Do you think I'm\\nsuch a miserable fool--do you think I could endure the position of a\\ntame cat? You forget I'm a man!... No; I'll never see you again now,\\nnot if it kills me!'\\n\\nAt these words, the first harsh ones she had ever heard from him, her\\nnerves gave way, and she burst into tears.\\n\\nThis made him irresolute, for his tender-heartedness almost reached the\\npoint of weakness. He went up to her, as she lifted her head, and\\nlooked at her once more. Then he said:\\n\\n'No, you've chosen. You _have_ been cruel to me, and you're too good to\\nhim. But I suppose you must carry out your own nature, Edith. I've been\\nthe victim. That's all.'\\n\\n'And won't you be friends?' she said.\\n\\n'No. I won't and I can't.'\\n\\nHe waited one moment more.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n'If you'll change your mind--you still can--we can still be happy. We\\ncan be everything to each other.... Give him up. Give him up.'\\n\\n'I can't,' said Edith.\\n\\n'Then, good-bye.'\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\nIntellectual Sympathy\\n\\n'What are you going to wear tonight, Edith?'\\n\\n'Oh; anything!'\\n\\n'Don't say anything. I don't wish you to wear anything. I'm anxious you\\nshould look your best, really nice, especially as we haven't been to\\nthe Mitchells' for so long. Wear your new blue dress.'\\n\\n'Very well.'\\n\\nBruce got up and walked across the room and looked in the glass.\\n\\n'Certainly, I'm a bit sunburnt,' he remarked thoughtfully. 'But it\\ndoesn't suit me badly, not really badly; does it?'\\n\\n'Not at all.'\\n\\n'Edith.'\\n\\n'Yes?'\\n\\n'If I've spoken about it once, I've spoken about it forty times. This\\nink-bottle is too full.'\\n\\n'I'll see about it.'\\n\\n'Don't let me have to speak about it again, will you? I wonder who will\\nbe at the Mitchells' tonight?'\\n\\n'Oh, I suppose there'll be the new person--the woman with the dramatic\\ncontralto foghorn voice; and the usual people: Mr Cricker, Lady\\nEverard, Miss Mooney--'\\n\\n'Miss Mooney! I hope not! I can't stand that woman. I think she's\\nabsurd; she's a mass of affectation and prudishness. And--Edith!'\\n\\n'Yes?'\\n\\n'I don't want to interfere between mother and daughter--I know you're\\nperfectly capable and thoroughly well suited to bringing up a girl, but\\nI really do think you're encouraging Dilly in too great extravagance.'\\n\\n'Oh! In what way?'\\n\\n'I found her making a pinafore for her doll out of a lace flounce of\\nreal old Venetian lace. Dilly said she found it on the floor. 'On the\\nfloor, indeed,' I said to her. 'You mustn't use real lace!' She said,\\n'Why not? It's a real doll!' Lately Dilly's got a way of answering back\\nthat I don't like at all. Speak to her about it, will you, Edith?'\\n\\n'Oh yes, of course I will.'\\n\\n'I'm afraid my mother spoils them. However, Archie will be going to\\nschool soon. Of course it isn't for me to interfere. I have always made\\na point of letting you do exactly as you like about the children,\\nhaven't I, Edith? But I'm beginning to think, really, Dilly ought to\\nhave another gov--' He stopped, looking self-conscious.\\n\\n'Oh, she's only five, quite a baby,' said Edith. 'I daresay I can\\nmanage her for the present. Leave it to me.'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSince his return, Edith had never once referred to Bruce's sea-voyage.\\nOnce or twice he had thanked her with real gratitude, and even remorse,\\nfor the line she had taken, but her one revenge had been to change the\\nsubject immediately. If Bruce wished to discuss the elopement that she\\nhad so laboriously concealed, he would have to go elsewhere.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA brilliantly coloured version, glittering with success and lurid with\\nmelodrama, had been given (greatly against the hearer's will) to\\nGoldthorpe at the club. One of the most annoying things to Bruce was\\nthat he was perfectly convinced, when he was confessing the exact\\ntruth, that Goldthorpe didn't believe a word of it.\\n\\nIt was unfortunate, too, for Bruce, that he felt it incumbent on him to\\nkeep it from Vincy; and not to speak of the affair at all was a real\\nsacrifice on Vincy's part, also. For they would both have enjoyed\\ndiscussing it, while Goldthorpe, the only human being in whom Bruce\\never really confided, was not only bored but incredulous. He considered\\nBruce not only tedious to the verge of imbecility, but unreliable\\nbeyond the pardonable point of inaccuracy. In fact, Bruce was his ideal\\nof the most wearisome of liars and the most untruthful of bores; and\\nhere was poor Vincy dying to hear all about his old friend, Mavis (he\\nnever knew even whether she had mentioned his name), ready to revel,\\nwith his peculiar humour, in every detail of the strange romance,\\nparticularly to enjoy her sudden desertion of Bruce for an unmarried\\ncommercial traveller who had fallen in love with her on board.--And\\nyet, it had to be withheld! Bruce felt it would be disloyal, and he had\\nthe decency to be ashamed to speak of his escapade to an intimate\\nfriend of his wife.\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBruce complained very much of the dullness of the early autumn in\\nLondon without Aylmer. This sudden mania for long journeys on Aylmer's\\npart was a most annoying hobby. He would never get such a pleasant\\nfriend as Aylmer again. Aylmer was his hero.\\n\\n'Why do you think he's gone away?' he rather irritatingly persisted.\\n\\n'I haven't the slightest idea.'\\n\\n'Do you know, Edith, it has sometimes occurred to me that if--that,\\nwell--well, you know what I mean--if things had turned out differently,\\nand you had done as I asked you--'\\n\\n'Well?'\\n\\n'Why, I have a sort of idea,' he looked away, 'that Aylmer might--well,\\nmight have proposed to you!'\\n\\n'Oh! _What_ an extraordinary idea!'\\n\\n'But he never did show any sign whatever, I suppose of--well,\\nof--being more interested in you than he ought to have been?'\\n\\n'Good heavens, no!'\\n\\n'Oh, of course, I know that--you're not his style. You liked him very\\nmuch, didn't you, Edith?...'\\n\\n'I like him very much now.'\\n\\n'However, I doubt if you ever quite appreciated him. He's so full of\\nability; such an intellectual chap! Aylmer is more a man's man. _I_\\nmiss him, of course. He was a very great friend of mine. And he didn't\\never at all, in the least--seem to--'\\n\\n'Seem to what?'\\n\\n'It would have been a very unfair advantage to take of my absence if he\\nhad,' continued Bruce.\\n\\n'Oh!'\\n\\n'But he was incapable of it, of course.'\\n\\n'Of course.'\\n\\n'He _never_ showed any special interest, then, beyond--'\\n\\n'Never.'\\n\\n'I was right, I suppose, as usual. You never appreciated him; he was\\nnot the sort of man a woman _would_ appreciate ... But he's a great\\nloss to me, Edith. I need a man who can understand--Intellectual\\nsympathy--'\\n\\n      *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n'Mr Vincy!' announced the servant.\\n\\nVincy had not lost his extraordinary gift for turning up at the right\\nmoment. He was more welcome than ever now.\\n\\n\\n\""
